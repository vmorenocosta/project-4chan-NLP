Systemd is...le good?,1651441251.0,g,86762517,21,3
What is wrong with systemd other than it violating a philosophy that may lead to future consequences of everything depending on it?

You'll start with getting into RED through their interview (read OP), then ranking up to Power user. Once your account age reaches  months (or maybe  months, can't remember what it was changed to) you can ask for an invite to AB. You can also request it in GGn but with the new account age requirements GGn can be skipped, I think.

Name a language that didn't break backwards compatibility? Even java had bugs in their stream map API where it wasn't lazy as expected. Fixing that was a breaking change.

"death grips . is mixed differently from the rest of jenny death, it's more in the style of bottomless pitit's hard to find good info about their production techniques, what I gather is that they aren't very maximalist in the sense that they only use a few different sounds/instruments at a time, JD being kind of an exception with the synths and guitar layered and all the compression giving it a ""busy"" sound. generally they leave a lot of room for the vocals. I think a lot of times the drums are triggered samples played on v-drums which makes the percussion recording and mixing process simpler. so usually it's drums, synth, and vocals, with some sound effects that typically are in a higher register than the vocals. I'm not an expert though. a lot of the ""magic"" I think is in the sound engineering which (I think) comes from andy's experience working on soundtracks. I would love to know more but obviously they don't talk about that stuff much. although there are a few interviews with Zach but I'm not sure how much he delves into the technical side of things",1651334185.0,g,86741957,1069,191

Doesn't need anything major there just something to round it out a little bit.I think it's a decent tune that largely just needs better instrumentation. Just my personal impression. But I'm not a fan of the whole whole older Japanese game music style to begin with (which is what it sounds like to me) so take my opinion with a mountain of salt.",1651390969.0,g,86741957,704,130
"This is great feedback. I had other tracks that I deleted pretty late, I felt like my melody had to stand out much more so I made it sharper. Now that there's less, the lead definitely comes off overbearing. As for the lack of bass, I use mth-x, which I've been told, boost the low end a decent amount, so on my end I felt like the balance was okay, I'll try to be more cognizant about it next time. And I really wasn't going for anything japanese inspire, unfortunately the synth I use to make my leads really lends itself to a small range of sounds I find pleasant, mainly it's square wave. I've gotten critiques about the sound selection before so ill try harder on that front as well. Appreciate the feedback boss.",1651391689.0,g,86741957,718,135

"I'm sorry but there sadly is nothing better than Arch.Debian patches too many things while not having enough maintainers to ensure that the patches that they do are actually high quality. Fedora changes too many things at least for me and with things like Silverblue you can see where Fedora is probably heading in the future and I personally don't like the concept of Silverblue.Gentoo is good but compiling takes a lot of time and with more and more things depending on Rust for example it will take even longer, I never manged to compile Rust myself I always had to use the bin package or else it would have probably taken days.NixOS while great in concept has bad documentation and some things that you might just assume to work won't work the way you think they would, so you will be searching for a lot of answers in random forum posts or ask on their IRC channel.Crux has some similarities to Arch but suffers from the same problem as Gentoo.Slackware is good if you like the concept and it works for you but if you want software that is not available in the base installation you will either have to compile it yourself or trust random bin packages.Arch sucks but there are some good things to it such as the pkgbuild format making it easy to write new packages that aren't in the main repos, the ABS is just great.And so is the AUR if you always check the provided pkgbuild file.Arch still suffers from the same things most Distros suffer from such as maintainers that just don't give a fuck but at least Arch makes it easy to maintain package yourself.",1651365261.0,g,86749397,1562,283

Not backup, just bulk storage. Also compressed storage with SSD cache, I have benefit of compression and caching without wasting local CPU cycles. Also hosts other services like quickly configurable WiFi AP for older machines, like on demand pseudo-secure WEP networks for old WiFi cards that I wouldn't want to keep on all the time. Also FTP, SMB and NFS file sharing for old machines, having my game libraries on a share and easily accessible on my old machines for example. Hosting boot files for network booting, etc.It also runs automated scripts, like uploading my valuable data to offsite backups, transparently without my interaction or worry.

You can add monitors on top of this one since most of the top is flat thoughGD is an ATX case though.

Yeah but if they turned it on it side and added at least a  intake in the front with a perforated panel I guarantee you the thermals would be way better. Like right now if you having it pulling from the bottom it's having to go through a small ~ inch opening and then through the perforated case panel and into your GPU where it then mostly gets vented out the back. If you have a full length GPU it's just blocking all that shit. The dimensional difference isn't even crazy either. Is it really that bad if it took up a few more inches horizontally? Is this something that never occurred to CM? Like I legit just don't get it.

"His reasons have never been correct because he is an incompetent hack.There are reasons for new languages:- the modern crop is increasingly complex (thanks, cniles!) and require absurdly expensive and advanced compilers (thanks cniles!) which increases the attack surface and makes porting efforts non-trivial, which has knock-on effects on just about everything (CPUs are designed for C rather than the other way around, for example, because it would be far too expensive to port a modern C compiler to a new platform -- see itanium fiasco for the aftermath of such an attempt -- and on the other side, new languages are hardly ever used/usable because it's near impossible to pour the same amount of money and manhours into developing those languages. This also has a knock-on effect on software, which are written as chimeric patches over chimeric patches over ancient software instead of clean-slate in a language more apt at expressing the domain being described, which creates massive technical debt and, once again, massive porting, security and understanding difficulty). Hence, smaller languages that remain capable of achieving modern goals are needed: wirth-like languages and forths are examples of this. More development in these arenas are needed.- There is still no obvious answer as to language sophistication maximalism vs minimalism (e.g. ""lisp vs forth"". While there is no ""modern forth"", the ""modern lisp"" in this example would be the likes of rust and its sophisticated borrow checker, by comparison with wirthian languages that rely on well-designed language with simple compilers and user's correct source transformations to work well). Exploring this is always a nice goal. This also includes exploring modern ideas like better heterogeneous compute or parallelization primitives.",1651439765.0,g,86762064,1804,278

"according to Mozilla developer Nicholas Nethercote, there is a -MB memory hit having Adblock Plus run in the background on Firefox. The main problem, though, is the process by which ABP actually blocks ads. Basically, ABP inserts a massive CSS stylesheet — occupying around MB of RAM — into every single webpage that you visit, stripping out the ads. This wouldn’t be a problem if we were still in the ’s or early ’s, but nowadays it is very common for a webpage to have lots of iframes, which are separate, individual webpages that are loaded and embedded within the page you’re currently looking at. The most common example is the ubiquitous social sharing widget (Facebook, Twitter, etc.) which is actually an iframe containing a separate webpage hosted on Facebook/Twitter’s servers. On a modern website, there can be dozens of iframes. On the ExtremeTech homepage there are , which is pretty low. In Nethercote’s testing, he found that TechCrunch used around MB of RAM without ABP enabled — but that doubled to MB with ABP enabled, after triggering all of the social widgets. In an extreme example, the VIM Color Scheme Test website — which has hundreds of iframes — goes from a few hundred megabytes of memory to almost two gigabytes. Nethercote only tested ABP’s memory consumption in Firefox, but we performed the same test in Chrome and got the same results.",1651437304.0,g,86761176,1367,233

Yes, there are games engine and stuff but this application is honestly halfway between maths and programming.Programming is an extension of maths, but mostly of DISCRETE maths (automatas, lambda calculus, symbolic manipulation, data structures, logic, combinatorics, set theory, formal language, PvsNP, etc).Of course if you're programming anything relating to CONTINUOUS maths like geometry, position of obects in space and any kind of physics modelisation, then of course Linear Algebra has its place.

If you have a list of points (a_n, b_n), then let Ax = b, where the rows of A correspond to evaluating the polynomial at one of your points (the first column is the zeroth power of the a_n's, the second is the first, etc), x is the column vector of coefficients of the polynomial, and b is a column vector containing the b_n's.We use matrix arithmetic to describe this because these kinds of problems are everywhere and we've come up with fast ways of working with them.

There are two possible solutions to this problem:() Using below % the battery water consumption is reduced, however it is then necessary to add small amounts of other elements such as sulphur, copper, arsenic and selenium. These act as grain refiners, decreasing the grain size of the lead and thereby increasing its hardness and strength.() Alkaline earth metals such as calcium can be used to stiffen the lead.

"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead%E%%acid_batteryhere:Sulfation and desulfationLead–acid batteries lose the ability to accept a charge when discharged for too long due to sulfation, the crystallization of lead sulfate.[] They generate electricity through a double sulfate chemical reaction. Lead and lead dioxide, the active materials on the battery's plates, react with sulfuric acid in the electrolyte to form lead sulfate. The lead sulfate first forms in a finely divided, amorphous state and easily reverts to lead, lead dioxide, and sulfuric acid when the battery recharges. As batteries cycle through numerous discharges and charges, some lead sulfate does not recombine into electrolyte and slowly converts into a stable crystalline form that no longer dissolves on recharging. Thus, not all the lead is returned to the battery plates, and the amount of usable active material necessary for electricity generation declines over time. I was right.It's a consequence of the electrolytic reaction. It gets crumbly over time.You get it all the time with car batteries. In fact, that probably explains my car battery issues now that I think about it. Thanks for making me relearn this.",1651435911.0,g,86758105,1188,178

"Alright, any of you ITT who think the movie ending was better should pay attention cause I'm gonna teach you a lesson:The whole point of Ozymandias' plan is to unite the world against a ""threat"" that's completely removed from the petty geopolitics of East vs West. Dr Manhattan is the USA's primary weapon/defense. In the world of Watchmen, he's the single most important part of their Cold War. He's a walking, talking, sentient A-bomb that is entirely at the command of the US government and single-handedly tips the balance of power. So if the plan was like the movie version, where Manhattan apparently nukes cities around the world, everyone would see it as America's fault for losing control of their pet god. No cooperation and peace would happen, because the Americans were dumb enough to play with fire and get everyone burnt.Meanwhile, the squid is completely removed from the situation. It's deliberately meant to be ridiculous and (almost) completely out of left-field. That's the whole point. It's an unknown, external threat to the planet that decimates only New York in an instant, and reminds the world there's far bigger things than politics. It's also the goriest part of an otherwise bloodless book, with half a dozen splash pages showing the extent of the destruction and chaos. Despite making everything else in the story bloodier, Snyder decided that THIS pivotal moment would be the one time where he dials back. The result is that the film's version is completely bloodless and unimpactful. Outside of the narrative, the squid also serves as a dark parody of the classic comic book tentacled alien monsters like Starro and fits in with the rest of Watchmen's conceit: it's a comic book cliche treated as realistically as possible. And for those of you saying that the squid doesn't work because someone would likely eventually uncover it, that's also the entire point of the ending. Manhattan cryptically tells Ozy that his plan was really only a short term fix.",1651438162.0,tv,167387889,1986,332

You can't sufficiently set up the squid in an already long film without detracting from everything else and fucking the pacing. It's the same reason why they didn't have the Tales of the Black Freighter segments. Plus, the general audience would've been absolutely fucking filtered by the squid and just called it stupid without understanding why. Replacing it with Manhattan is a half decent fix to a difficult problem. It streamlines a lengthy film while still providing the essential elements of the ending, even if it doesn't hold up to closer scrutiny.

In the Watchmen universe where the US has been using Manhattan instead of nukes that Dead Hand System would probably extend to measuring the specific energy his attacks give off, launching all the nukes they have if that energy is detected in conjunction with a city going offline.  On the off chance that this somehow didn't happen because the Soviets decided to just let themselves be killed rather than destroy the world, then everyone else on earth would unite with the Soviets in blaming the Americans for creating a sociopathic God with no known weaknesses and then pissing him off with court cases and the media slurring him to the point where he decides to kill millions and leave in a huff.

"Reviews are out for that Pike show.'Star Trek: Strange New Worlds' has promise, and the usual frustrationsThere's a fun show in there, buried under clanky dialogue and odd plotting.having now seen the first half of the first season (a second is already in production) I can say that Strange New Worlds will be a frustrating watch for fans. Frustrating because there are the bones of a really fun, interesting Star Trek series buried deep inside Strange New Worlds. Sadly, it’s trapped in the usual mix of faux-melodrama, clanging dialogue and dodgy plotting with the usual lapses in logic. Many writers are blind to their own flaws, which is why it’s so amusing that this is what Kurtzman and co. feel is a radical departure from their own work.Maybe I’m being unfair, but this is the seventh season of live-action Star Trek released under Kurtzman’s purview. The three lead characters all had a full season of Discovery to bed in, too, so it’s not as if everyone’s starting from cold. But despite the gentlest of starts, the show still manages to stumble out of the gate, trying to do too much and not enough at the same time. The first four episodes, especially, feel as if someone’s trying to speed-read you through a whole season’s worth of plot in a bunch of partly-disconnected episodes.https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-strange-new-worlds-preview-.html",1651438655.0,tv,167390785,1360,223

"I enjoyed the ending, as a statement of power. The key to the ending is in Sattem’s final words:“You don’t get to win… The world doesn’t work like that.”Except that’s exactly how the world does work. Those who don’t win in the game of power are discarded at first glance. There’s no going back.They brought the S chick back as a foil to this accumulation of power. She is the layman, watch her reaction as all of the changes are laid before her, particularly the FBI’s approval of it. It’s important to track the thoughts of the characters versus the actions, as with Marty. “Just one more thing, then we go clean”. Except that’s not how it ever works. Note in the finale, Ruth commits to going clean, with a fresh record, ready to right the wrongs of her family. Instead, she is murdered by her past. Then you have Jonah, who even jokingly says “I’ll go clean at least until high school.” Him pulling the trigger at the end is important as it signifies his acceptance of what the family has not only done up to this point, but also what needs to be done to keep it going. Remember he’s been the main antagonist within the family the last two seasons. The murder happening at the end reminds the viewer that the Byrde family, while having successfully navigated their circumstances we’ve gotten to witness, will have to continue with force to maintain their attained power, and thus will never truly be clean.",1651442140.0,tv,167386284,1409,254

Maybe if deniro and moretz were in a relationship they might have just kept going through the scene, but they were not, and they did not.

"It is only the man whose intellect is clouded by his sexual instinct that could give that stunted, narrow-shouldered, broad-hipped, and short-legged race the name of the fair sex; for the entire beauty of the sex is based on this instinct. One would be more justified in calling them the unaesthetic sex than the beautiful. Neither for music, nor for poetry, nor for fine art have they any real or true sense and susceptibility, and it is mere mockery on their part, in their desire to please, if they affect any such thing.This makes them incapable of taking a purely objective interest in anything, and the reason for it is, I fancy, as follows. A man strives to get direct mastery over things either by understanding them or by compulsion. But a woman is always and everywhere driven to indirect mastery, namely through a man; all her direct mastery being limited to him alone. Therefore it lies in woman’s nature to look upon everything only as a means for winning man, and her interest in anything else is always a simulated one, a mere roundabout way to gain her ends, consisting of coquetry and pretence. Hence Rousseau said, Les femmes, en général, n’aiment aucun art, ne se connoissent à aucun et n’ont aucun génie (Lettre à d’Alembert, note xx.). Every one who can see through a sham must have found this to be the case. One need only watch the way they behave at a concert, the opera, or the play; the childish simplicity, for instance, with which they keep on chattering during the finest passages in the greatest masterpieces. If it is true that the Greeks forbade women to go to the play, they acted in a right way; for they would at any rate be able to hear something. In our day it would be more appropriate to substitute taceat mulier in theatro for taceat mulier in ecclesia; and this might perhaps be put up in big letters on the curtain.",1651424752.0,tv,167379663,1857,333

"Dinosaurs have spread across the world, and InGen’s rival company BioSyn has been capturing and housing them at BioSyn Valley, a weather-controlled sanctuary in the Arctic.Owen and Claire are in hiding to protect both Maisie as well as Blue and her daughter Beta, but mercenaries capture both Maisie and Beta.Meanwhile, Ellie Sattler is investigating a swarm of locusts that have been ravaging crops and believes BioSyn is responsible because only their crops haven’t been affected.Ellie asks Alan Grant and Ian Malcolm for help. Ian has been working for BioSyn and agrees to help them sneak into BioSyn’s research center at BioSyn Valley.Owen and Claire recruit pilot Kayla Watts to transport them and locate the mercs at an underground dinosaur auction in Malta, but the mercs release Atrociraptors to kill them.Owen, Claire and Kayla escape and fly to BioSyn Valley, but are attacked by the Quetzalcoatlus and crash.Owen and Kayla fight a Pyroraptor in the ice while Claire falls into the artificial forest and encounters the Therizinosaurus.Owen, Claire and Kayla meet with Alan, Ellie and Ian and they sneak into the research center and run into Dr. Henry Wu and his assistant Ramsey Cole.Wu is being blackmailed into working for BioSyn and is regretful of his past actions, and has secretly been compiling evidence against them.The group finds out BioSyn CEO Lewis Dodgson has created the locusts so BioSyn can control the world’s economy, and abducted Maisie because her DNA has the cure to a rare disease.",1651439106.0,tv,167391407,1513,246
"Dodgson has also been cloning his own dinosaurs, conditioning them to attack humans and releasing them into the world to ensure his company is paid to round them up.Dodgson decides to destroy the locusts to cover up his crimes, but they escape and set BioSyn Valley on fire, causing the dinosaurs to escape.The group is chased by Dimetrodons, but manages to escape through a series of underground tunnels. Alan stabs a Dimetrodon with his Raptor claw.Dodgson also escapes but is cornered and killed by a Dilophosaurus in a manner very similar to Dennis Nedry.The group is cornered by the Giganotosaurus outside the facility, but the T-Rex arrives to help, bursting through the Jurassic Park logo.Rexy and the Giga have an old rivalry and battle while the gang escapes on a helicopter, bringing along the evidence Wu compiled against BioSyn.Giga gains the upper hand and appears to be about to kill Rexy when she turns the table and kills the Giga with assist from the Therizinosaurus. Rexy and Therizinosaurus both survive.Owen, Claire and Maisie reunite Beta and Blue, while Alan, Ellie and Ian expose BioSyn Valley with Wu’s help and rescue the dinosaurs.Without BioSyn tipping the scales, humans and dinosaurs will be able to reach a natural balance that will allow both to coexist without affecting the ecosystem.",1651439137.0,tv,167391407,1317,217

In order to make the children equal in the situation you've outlined, the punishment has to be the same regardless of the context of the situation. They think they are doing a good thing and making the world a better place by doing this. It's ""social justice"" at its core.

"It's over, nutrekbros...'Star Trek: Strange New Worlds' has promise, and the usual frustrationsThere's a fun show in there, buried under clanky dialogue and odd plotting.having now seen the first half of the first season (a second is already in production) I can say that Strange New Worlds will be a frustrating watch for fans. Frustrating because there are the bones of a really fun, interesting Star Trek series buried deep inside Strange New Worlds. Sadly, it’s trapped in the usual mix of faux-melodrama, clanging dialogue and dodgy plotting with the usual lapses in logic. Many writers are blind to their own flaws, which is why it’s so amusing that this is what Kurtzman and co. feel is a radical departure from their own work.Maybe I’m being unfair, but this is the seventh season of live-action Star Trek released under Kurtzman’s purview. The three lead characters all had a full season of Discovery to bed in, too, so it’s not as if everyone’s starting from cold. But despite the gentlest of starts, the show still manages to stumble out of the gate, trying to do too much and not enough at the same time. The first four episodes, especially, feel as if someone’s trying to speed-read you through a whole season’s worth of plot in a bunch of partly-disconnected episodeshttps://www.engadget.com/star-trek-strange-new-worlds-preview-.html",1651436919.0,tv,167389706,1348,219

"Stupid boring Viking film about vikings raping and pillaging. I definitely needed to watch a bunch Viking monkeys raid, pillage, enslave and rape a Slavic village in Ukraine, while the same fucking thing is happening to Ukraine in the real world. I sure hope no Ukrainians fucking watched this. And the fact that Robert Eggers has the nerve to fucking evoke Come and See of all things for his shitty generic Viking revenge film. Guys, Amleth is a decent Viking. He won’t kill women and children. He just helps the raiders subjugate the village that end up killing women and children (this is a trope I consistently see in media portraying viking stories when it comes the protagonists in these stories as a way to whitewash their actions and the actions of what being a viking actually is). But hey, at least he gets his hot slavic trad waifu. She doesn’t seem to mind that he helped pillage and enslave her people and village. As long as she gets to bear him children that’s all that matters. Glad to see the fetishised slavic woman presented as a reward is alive and well in fucking Hollywood movies. It’s important that all the Swedish boomers online feel good about themselves about how their ancestors helped established the Kiev en Rus. This movie further solidifies how I will always hate Germanic, Scandinavian and ESPECIALLY Viking culture for the sub human way they’ve treated slavic populations, from the Viking age all the way to WWII. Like literally, what Vikings did was no different at all from what the Nazis were doing on the Eastern Front. The film even evokes Come and See. So why do people differentiate them from fucking SS Stormtroopers and Nazis? Because it was a different time period with different moral values? Then why do we keep fucking obsessing with periods of history with the characters that have these backwards morals and values? Because it’s interesting and badass? Fuck this shitty ass movie.

It's easy to stand out and feel special as a / when you're in a podunk town full of mutants but when you're surrounded by other s and s on a constant basis then you're no longer an exclusive commodity.

"It's over, nutrekbros...'Star Trek: Strange New Worlds' has promise, and the usual frustrationsThere's a fun show in there, buried under clanky dialogue and odd plotting.having now seen the first half of the first season (a second is already in production) I can say that Strange New Worlds will be a frustrating watch for fans. Frustrating because there are the bones of a really fun, interesting Star Trek series buried deep inside Strange New Worlds. Sadly, it’s trapped in the usual mix of faux-melodrama, clanging dialogue and dodgy plotting with the usual lapses in logic. Many writers are blind to their own flaws, which is why it’s so amusing that this is what Kurtzman and co. feel is a radical departure from their own work.Maybe I’m being unfair, but this is the seventh season of live-action Star Trek released under Kurtzman’s purview. The three lead characters all had a full season of Discovery to bed in, too, so it’s not as if everyone’s starting from cold. But despite the gentlest of starts, the show still manages to stumble out of the gate, trying to do too much and not enough at the same time. The first four episodes, especially, feel as if someone’s trying to speed-read you through a whole season’s worth of plot in a bunch of partly-disconnected episodes.https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-strange-new-worlds-preview-.html",1651436856.0,tv,167389362,1349,219

And that plot arc, as the other anon I quoted noted, was ingeniously accurate as far as the two sexes go. Men, when they interpret something as rejection, get very upset but also loose and non-committal as a coping mechanism; it's a technique to move on quickly and get back into the game so that you can reset and become functional and productive in short order. Women, on the other hand, ALWAYS hedge their bets. ALWAYS. They keep one foot in the door, hide behind ambiguities, then wait for the moment to take a vague gray area and treat it like a black-and-white, strict reading when it suits their needs.

Think of Riffler as basically a vigilante piscopath who is murdering members of Gotham's crime family. Then you have Batman doing the same thing but with non-lethality. There's room to play as a vigilante without going out of bounds. The enemy being more realistic, the result can be more playful and from there you can escalate in unreality but in controllable proportions.",1651439113.0,tv,167389041,479,80

Depends where you live. In Europe bourbon is more expensive than scotch if you just compare their age. Pricewise scotch uses the more expensive malt instead of maize. Still both are very cheap compared to fruits. Scotch on the other hand mostly uses used barrels that are much cheaper than new ones but is often is aged longer. Also scotch uses pot stills that are more expensive to use than column stills bourbon is typically distilled in.,1651442013.0,ck,17782713,440,77
"/ of the flavor in whiskey will be from the barrel/cask. climate can accelerate aging as well as the volume of spirit to wood ratio i.e. smaller cask will age the contents faster. Scotch is mostly refill ex bourbon and refill sherry wood, so not only is effect of the wood lessened from prior usages but the climate also keeps the woods relatively inactive. quality is / split of patiently made spirit and considerate maturation. rushed spirit will be hot and bland. nonchalant maturation will produce insignificant aid to even good spirit.some distillers like their product to be more spirit driven and others like lots of wood influence and there are practices for achieving either consistantly.the main difference with Kentucky straight bourbon is the required use of virgin white oak whereas the majority of other oak aged spirits will not be using this a main flavor/aging component, but it's possible for it to be used as a bandaid to large batches of something lower quality, the same goes for sherry wood. the very nature of bourbon is more bold than Scotch, but also less nuanced.",1651442291.0,ck,17782713,1089,185

Some middle eastern recipes that use this ratio add a splosh of olive oil or butter and go up to  minutes to get a crispy golden crust on the bottom that steams back soft and breaks up into the rest of it when you fluff it.The other key is that once you stir and turn the heat down low, never ever remove the lid on rice until that set cooking time is up.",1651438646.0,ck,17783394,608,123

"Careful not to fall into the autism-hole of “only one right best method”, friend. It sometimes depends on the type of rice, its age, and what you’re using it for. I use japonica short grain and rinse it simply to remove the “rice dust” it gets from being in a sack of rice. I rinse it until most of the ‘white’ is gone from the water. I don’t bother continuing until it’s perfectly clear, and don’t know anyone who thinks doing so is necessary. My wife is Japanese and just soaks rice the way her mom always has. An hour or so before making rice in the evening (sometimes longer if it isn’t “new” rice), and overnight in the fridge if the rice is going to be made in the morning. The exception is if it’s going to be used to sushi or onigiri, then she does min.

radiation nuclearListen retards go into your microwave with a screw driver and find me some strontium or uranium or plutonium!It uses electric coils & magnets to create an arc/wave between the two sides of the box that is attracted to the water inside your food & heats it up as it transfers its energy into the liquids on the spinning plate. the energy that doesn't go into or passes through the food is bounced off the wall at a weaker strength which is why the plate spins (so your food isn't cooked mostly only on one side.

Adding - layers to a factory seasoned pan seems fine to me, though maybe some of the more high end cast iron brands may not need it. Then again paying extreme prices for cast iron kind of defeats the purpose in my opinion.What you say is true, but I think putting aside half a day to thoroughly season a new pan or wok that you just got is worth it.

"You can have good Döner all over germany, it's hardly a local thing to Berlin, even if that is where it originated from. In the past the Gemüsedöners were hard to find in other cities, but nowadays even of those you can find one in pretty much every decent sized city I've ever been to.It's not like Berlin has nothing to offer, it's definitely a interesting city, but there's a reason for the ""ach berlin"" meme, compared to the capitals of other countries it's... unique. Peter Fox really hit it on the nail with Schwarz zu Blau. Frankfurt is similar in how its appeal and nastyness are interwoven in a way",1651168249.0,ck,17768187,607,111
"Sorry if you are a norf broI am a southwest german, which culinarily is actually a good place to be. Bayern has great food, but it's very heavy, a schweinshaxe with Knödel, a good maß Weizenbier or some Weißwurst with Bretzen and Obatzder are great on a visit, but not what I would want to eat regularly myself.I live near the Rhine, so we have great whine, Spundekäs (think of it as a variation to obatzder thats a bit lighter), Blutwurst, Handkäs' mit Musik (which takes getting used to but has the best macros you can hope for if you ignore the salt) and similar stuff.Personally something that I love and that is easy to make yourself is Flammkuchen - it's originated in the elsace, which has this interesting mixture of german and french cuisine and seems rather local to this area. You can find it all over germany sometimes, but here is where it's popular and internationally it's still pretty unknown. It's like a easier to make pizza without levening or much resting time that can be savory (traditional is leek, onion and bacon) or sweet (apple or pear or banana with honey). Instead of tomatosauce you add Schmand (similar to sour cream, but make sure it's over % fat content) and you bake it to be very thin and crispy. You also have a bit more of the french way of life with markets often selling wine that you drink in a Schorle or pure while shopping. It's quite nice.Munich and Vienna both seem like amazing cities.They really are worth a visit, I have good memories from both.",1651168673.0,ck,17768187,1493,270

I mean they just sell schnitzel. It's hard to fuck that up. Also you don't eat all that stuff with gravy though. Gravy is just served with dishes that are braised in gravy like roasts.,1651170705.0,ck,17768187,184,35

"I mean I can't speak to how authentic the taste will be, but let me go through it:Schnitzel - A classic, looks decent, even if here your Schnitzels would be bigger and presumably flatter. Having the sauce with it is soemthing that you will see all over germany (that's how I grew up with it), but in austria you usually won't have sauce. They call it ""Schnitzel with tunke"" and consider it as horrible as adding pineapple on pizza is to italians.Spätzle - A classic and very essential to south western germany. Those on the menu look a bit wet and short (more like knöpfle). If you want to try Spätzle I would recommend making them yourself. It's really easy and fast (much easier than pasta) and if you fuck up at worst you get Knöpfle, which are still good.Currywurst - A takeaway classic from berlin. The secret is the sauce and from that pic I can't tell if it's good or bad - or if its the west or east german version either. ""Der party bites"" - Apart from being gramatically incorrect I wouldn't consider that authentic german cooking.The gravies look decent, without tasting it I can't say much.Cucumber Salad - A classic that you often get at restaurants, looks decent.Potato Salad - I'm personally not a big fan of it, but is in undoubtedly a traditional german dish and theirs looks decent.Strudel - Also technically more an Austrian thing, but it tastes good so sure.Overall it looks okay, but it's more of austiran/south western german food. What most americans think of when they say southern german food is actually moreso south east germany, which is bayern, with their Knoedel, Schweinshaxe, the various forms of Braten, sausage, lye bretzen and beer etc. Those things in that restaurant are hard to fuck up, but also not really the types of dishes that I think justify going to a restaurant for, except maybe the schnitzel.

"(cont)What makes south german food so great to eat in restaurants is that it all takes ages to make, where you continually baste your meat over long periods of time. A proper Haxe or Braten is a lot of effort at home, but in a resturant you get to enjoy it without those issues. Same with most Knoedel, or Rouladen etc. It's because a lot of traditional german food had its inception when one person in the household (the mother) was home the whole day and could spare the time to make these intense and high effort dishes (if the money wasn't as tight that is). Stuff like Spätzle, Flammkuchen, etc. are so easy (almost foolproof) and quick to make that I see little point in going somewhere for it. Other dishes are hard to make because you will have trouble sourcing the ingredients (handkäse,quark, special sausages and pickled krauts being typical contenders).The stuff that makes most sense to get in a restaurant this hansel&Gretel place doesn't seem to serve.But it may still be worth it, maybe look at reviews for the place. Ultimately it's hard to tell just from the menu. At least the idea behind the recipes are authentic to Austria or south west germany.",1651171211.0,ck,17768187,1167,207

"I will try that Flammkuchen if it's easy even though I don't cook with dough much.The only thing you need to get right with Flammkuchen is the hydration pretty much - pizza dough is so shit to make at home because it takes time for the levening to do it's thing and some people ferment it etc. With Flammkuchen dough, as long as ""feels"" right in your hands you're pretty much set. Hope it comes out great. If you ever decide to make Spätzle, it's a similar thing in that actual ratios for the dough hydration are more of a feeling thing, but your rough guide would be  egg per g of flour, salt to taste and add water until the consistency is right. Alternatively there is a swabian version that uses  eggs per g flour. Mix that dough together, get a pot of water to boil (salt the water), and a cutting board that fits into the pot. Wet the board (or let it soak for a bit until it absorbed all the water), add a bit of dough onto the board, spread thin, then wet the top of the dough too. Now with a knife or a dough scraper ""roll"" strips of dough into the boiling pot. It takes some skill to be consistent, but even kids can do it if you don't care as much about consistency or length.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YGahMmY is a youtube video of a german grandma making them in a heavy accent, the scraping happens at  seconds. That's how my grandma used to make them too. Then either serve as is, with gravy or cheese or caramelized onions, or put in the oven with onions and cheese to bake a bit.For the Flammkuchen, just make the dough, let it rest a bit (doesn't need much), roll out thin, add Schmand and your toppings and put into a very hot oven.

Don't know how to describe it but it's got a nice aftertaste.Green spotGreen apple. This is about the only strong flavor note I've got from a whiskey so far. Not as creamy as RB as I'd hoped.Old Grandad BiBThis was good. Maybe a bit harsh, but probably just the % ethanol. Price is right.Bulleit RyeA spicy rye without the harshness of old overholt.Dickel RyeTastes the same as bulleit but is cheaper.Buffalo TraceTried this long ago and didn't care for it. Weird aftertaste I recall.Glenfiddich Describe this one as ""chewy"" or ""doughey"" or round for some reason. Good.Glenmorangie Similar to Glenfiddich  but cheaper.Teeling small batchDevoid of flavor.Monkey ShoulderSweet, tasty, good price.Glendronach Fruity flavor I recall.

"It depends on what you want. You have two options: One is getting a cheap, but decent knife. The first knive I ever got for myself was a CrMov steel santoku from aliexpress and I got it for dirt cheap, I still use it and it still holds up amazing. You need to adjust expectations accordingly though. For some reason Kiwi brand knives are popular here on /ck/, and they are dirt cheap, but their steel is insanely soft, you will feel the knife get dull within a few uses. Upside is it's piss easy to sharpen due to how soft the steel is (and any shitty sharpening method will do a good job). Personally I prefer my cheap santoku to my Kiwi though, despite their price difference being very little, the santoku holds its edge for a month or more depending on usage and ""needs"" sharpening after around half a year, while the Kiwi gets noticably duller after a week and is in desperate need of sharpening after a month.The second, more premium way is to get a good steel. The price increases towards top end knives are insane, and the materials often don't justify it. A shun knive for example with their ""VG MAX"" steel costs a shitton, while you can get a VG knife for a fraction of the cost with equal performance (VG max is just marketing for VG supposedly). So to get a good deal you want a knife that uses a good steel, a sharpening stone with appropriate grits and then you are set. Once you know it uses the right materials get the cheapest that has decent ergonomics. Brands and fancy looks raise prices with little return in terms of value added. Chef Wang explains it well in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjMBuPrXt , but obviously unless you like chinese cleavers apply what he says to normal western knives. is kind of what I am talking about when I talked about Kiwi knives.

For me as I said I feel my Kiwi dull noticably after a week of use, but to be clear at that point it is still very sharp. After - weeks I personally prefer resharpening it though. I think if you are a normie who never sharpens his knives then the Kiwi knives are actually better than some more expensive steels, because of how thin the blade is. Essentially due to the thinness of the blade most normies think it retains a nice edge, when actually it's dull already. That's why I gifted a Kiwi to my parents, they would never sharpen anything, but they love the Kiwi, because if the kiwi gets dull its still usable. If a more expensive and thicker knife gets dull its gets painful.are actually using the knife that requires such obnoxiously overengineered steel.It's ""cool"" and people want to have something that ""is the best"".

But I also believe it's due to a lack of experience for a lot of people. All they ever had was bottom of the bargain bin types of knives (think dull ceramic supermarket knife, or old cheap knife that has not once been honed or sharpened in its lifetime) and they jump from there to absolute premium model. They believe that the price they payed was necessary to get the jump in quality, because they skipped the whole middle segment of the market, which is in most markets the part where you get the best value for your money usually.

So only get those for normal sized western chefs knives. If you decide on one of those, make sure the sticks aren't too thick or you'll split them and that they seem sturdy. Try not to insert knives longer than /ths of the height of the sticks I these. I also have a magnet bar for cleavers and santokus, make sure to have a place to attach those, that the magnets are strong enough and if you can either get one that has some protection for the edge (silicon or wood over the magnets rather than steel) or be careful when attaching the knives to go ""spine first"". Those magnetic angled wooden boards are decent but take too much space for my tastes. A solid wood block looks nice and lasts ages, but you either need to get it with a set, have no unusual knife sizes, or custom order it, so that's often out.Obsessing over brand for knife blocks is dumb, as long as the joints are done decently well and the material (wood type) is decent the band shouldn't matter much.

"It's a preference thing, but that's how I felt at the time, too. There's two main things that I really like about the taller blade:- Larger surface area on the knife, which means scooping up ingredients is easier- The taller the blade the easier it is to cut with it if you use your non dominant hand as the blade guide (With how I chop the dominant hand is mainly responsible for the angle and the chopping motion, while I press the blade against my non dominant hand, which holds the ingredients in place and determines the position of the cut)Another thing I really like is a straight cutting edge, rather than a curved edge. It makes the ""rocking"" motion impossible, but in return it allows for straight cuts and makes chopping/slicing easier.All three of these things are better on a Santoku than on a western chefs knife, which is why I originally switched to a Santoku. They are even better on a slicing cleaver than they are on a Santoku, which is why I then switched to that.That being said they have disadvantages, too. The biggest ones are that the knife is overall larger, which makes small and precise cuts harder (though doable with skill). The straight edge removes the option of rocking the knife over ingredients and the bigger surface area of the cleaver means the same length of blade will weigh considerably more in cleaver form than in chef knife form. In return slicing cleavers are often thinner than Santokus and chef knives, but most that I have tried are still a little heaver than the alternatives. This takes some getting used to as well. I keep a small pairing knife around for those small precise cuts you occasionally want, though I have seen more skilled people just use the cleaver for % of the workload.",1651430690.0,ck,17769321,1737,309

This was in the days before a proper kitchen, and there was a tiny freezer unit that could only hold what was on the top shelf, and often that was some random combination of Chinese or Indian takeout. A couple of times a week we’d have what seemed like the best of everything, but the rest of the time it was pretty terrible: a frozen piece of some meat and whatever was frozen with it, a tub of rice, and maybe a can of green peas, and maybe a can of baby corn. There was a few times in my childhood when we were treated to something really good, like fresh fish that one of the waiters brought home in a plastic bag.

You can also spend some money on soy sauce so your taste buds don't die. This is how I lived when I was broke as a joke.

I wondered the same thing but upon googling and seeing various oil-based recipes everyone says somewhere between  days and a week.I think it's because oil goes rancid once exposed to aid but all the other ingredients you're adding introduce microbes. Any fresh garlic you add (which you would be using for most styles of chirry oil but definitely for italian garlic/oil dip) starts to rot pretty quickly.Obviously if you pasteurize it properly like you would any jarred/canned preserve you're fine but that's not practical for most people,1651392263.0,ck,17780386,538,87

"Where I live you don't need an ID. I am not OP but I live in rural michigan and the food bank giveaways around me happen because of covid and shit STILL.

So, I'll give the meat to other people. Here are some examples of what is given out for free, and it's all on the honor system. I actually go pick up crates for four families, the place just gives it to me no questions asked (I do deliver it to the families, I don't keep it)Pack of  cans of chick peasPack of  diet pepsihuge bag of processed chicken patties, maybe ~lbs of onionslbs of potatoes~ tomatoes cabbageslots of baked goods about to expire, given out as a last ditch effort to not waste it, cakes, fruit pies, bread, muffins~ peppers jugs of grape juice boxes of poptartsHeavily processed, gross lbs of corned beefLots more random local produce like random broccoli heads etc.They never give out grains or calorie dense food -usually- although there are some exceptions there. And yes I can just go get a package this big any day I want to from various food banks, or all of them if I wanted to, and all the food they have varies dramatically.It got zero news coverage, but there was a thing called 'farmers to families' all over the USA from the start of  through the end of .

"Thanks for the reply. There must have been a bit of a misunderstanding, though, because what I was trying to say is in complete agreement with the points you made. As I said, I moved to a city coming from a rural upbringing, and both yuppies and trust fund “artists” are groups which I don’t fit into. My post was literally about getting away from that, because having peeked into the college kid wannabe creative environment of one such expensive city, I can tell that I’d rather look for something else. Hence why moving to a cheap country far away sounds more appealing to me than moving to the “bohemian” neighbourhood of whatever western European city. I don’t think creative communities should be always reduced to “basic bitch trust fund kids”, though. Automatically thinking that’s the case is almost equally detestable to me. While it is true that they’re not necessary for the creation of great art, it also true that Joyce for example was an active member of the intellectual circles of Trieste and Paris (among other cities) in his days, and that a lot of his innovation came from dialogue and correspondence with many of his contemporaries. Not to mention the publication of his works, which may have been impossible if he wasn’t in the right place at the right time.. But that’s kind of beside my point. I am not an artist and don’t want to pretend to be one. Mentioning cities becoming expensive was to say that Europe today is rather different from Joyce’s, when - contrary to what you’re saying - moving to a specific city/neighbourhood because other artists lived there would have made sense. To be completely honest I do think period-blood painters would probably make better friends than equally basic people who don’t even pretend like art is important to them, but they’re really just a false stereotype and my original post had nothing to do with them. I brought up the (bygone) “coolness” of cities to make a point about the pointlessness (and obnoxiousness) of thinking in those terms. That’s why, having landed a remote job, I was asking about the feasibility of leaving all this behind. You mention Eastern Europe, but I was thinking about English-speaking African countries where life is much cheaper, and the cultural experience would be much more insightful. That’s kind of what I was asking, not where is the Coolest place to move to, but would it be too crazy (at my age) to just go travel (regardless of the of Coolness of cities and all that)...",1651341551.0,lit,20300543,2479,430

I do not ask my bus driver for an interview, and I do not ask my garbage man for a selfie. And yet because someone enjoys what someone else has made, they then try to meet the person and ask for something else. My pocket knife means a lot to me and has gotten me through some tough times, but I don't track down the maker just to tell them their work means a lot to me. And what is it about autographs in the first place? Why is writing down one's name meaningful when it comes to famous people?Why do people who make purchases for their enjoyment pretend they do it solely to support the creator? Why must the creator bend to the will of others under the threat of ""I won't support you if you don't do X""?And why must the celebrity do interviews? It seems like the less we know about creators, the more mysterious and interesting they are (we still debate about who Homer was). Isn't it better to let the work speak for itself?

"To the anon who was shilling for this a while back, you failed to mention how the protagonist, who is a first person narrator of his own story, goes into a several page digression on how he studied sex magic for several years as part of his academy training, which included having sex with his smoking hot research partner, a rich daughter of an old imperial family that wasn't interested in a relationship just sex for research purposes. He does not go into any mechanical detail about how sex magic works and only talks vaguely about how much sex he was having on a daily basis, and how his association with her research was how he established himself as magical researcher in good standing. Sex magic was never mentioned before this, or even hinted to exist, at any point. So the protagonist's experience, even expertise at it, is pretty much as irrelevant as if he revealed a talent for limericks and studying under a renowned limerick master for years. It's only brought up at all because he needed to meet with his former research partner. Not for sex magic reasons, though. He simply needed somebody rich and influential to get the word out to help him, and she was the only wealthy, influential person he knew that would give him the time of day. And there was no implication sex magic was going to be relevant at all in the story after this.To sum up: you could remove all references to sex magic from this book and lose nothing. It is something he inserted into the story as background flavor, without any connection to the plot or existing characters, and which does not in any way change our understanding of events or people we've seen so far. In fact it does not even serve to characterize the protagonist as a lusty, virile young man since he already got that across in a previous flashback narration where he talked about how he chased tail all the time as a baker's son, and was successful more often than not.So I just wanted to say: thanks for recommending me this story, it's really fun and I hope it gets even saucier.

"okay yeah so you can start at either point depending on your interest. If you ever check out a typical Evola book's index, Guenon and Nietzsche are by far the most mentioned people and he essentially tries to synthesize the two authors. So if I start with Nietzsche, and then get to Evola through Nietzsche, then what do I do?go ahead and read Ride the Tiger. like half of the book is Nietzsche talk.Then I would go to Guenon's start here and work your way down to Revolt and then sideways back to Ride the Tiger and re-read it.The important prerequisite before reading Revolt is to have a solid understanding of Guenon's 'Tradition'. Once that clicks you will be able to grasp Evola easily.Does it matter/ am I looking too much into it?im on chinz (pol and lit) all the time, if you ever see me feel free to ask questions.

"This. If anything, AI will write genre fiction better than any human ever could. It'll put fantasy writers, lowbrow erotica peddlers, DUDE SCIENCE bros etc. all out of business. Because of the iterative way in which AI learns, the formulaic way in which most genre fiction novels are written will lend to AI an easy facilitation.

It takes the death of the author to its absolute extreme, in that no touch of the author's artistry—his skill with the medium itself, the way in which he interacts with it, the tiny little elements of human subjectivity that are peppered everywhere in great literature—can be allowed to shine through for fear of alienating the highly-targeted commercial demographics. AI will just be able to do that better. I don't see how an AI will be able to do the equivalent of what Joyce did.

"I would say to people thinking about a career in the creative field, to be aware of that you have to be very critical of your own work. You have to be of a completely divided mind. You have to be your biggest fan and your biggest critic simultaneously because there are too many people who are their own biggest fans and can see absolutely nothing wrong with their work. It's a balancing act which you have to apply to yourself to. To distill it: If you're a creative person, think of the body of work. What do you leave behind? At what point do you change from being at that level, as far as most of your audience in concerned, and peter off or go into completely commercialized aspects of whatever you were doing, just playing off your name? It's very difficult, because you keep yourself in a prison. It's very much like a hermitage. Where does enlightenment come from? The moment you strip everything else away until there's just you, the odds are better that you're going to have it. I think creative people have to realize that is is the essence of it. The urge to companionship, which is a universal human condition, is very bad for creativity because it has to come out of you. It has to be what you feel inside, what it is that you want to say, and how you want it to come out on paper.

"I'm being a bit over the top to be fair, but not by much.

This also includes creating flawed characters or people who act irrationally. Stupid or simple people generally have a hard time imagining how even people close to them think or see the world, let along imagining a fictional person and coming up with experiences and motives and defining traits for them that offer explanations for why they are the way they or what they want or what their place in a story is. You have to have some kind of ego to write characters successfully because you're sort of asserting that you can not only craft all the dolls but play their parts all to perfection yourself. So sure, maybe not ""sociopathic"", but egotistical. Maybe egotistical to a flaw. It's the same reason why people find themselves disappointed with love/dating.

"“Move Move Move!” bellowed the First Sergeant. It’s not like I can’t hear the blaring siren or see the red strobe lights. Private Leer thought as he scrambled to the SAMS Staging Platform. It was the Private’s first jump as an official Spacebourne Trooper. Leer was perplexed on why he was shaking so hard. It was a much rougher time in boot plus he had done multiple training jumps throughout the Sun System. Is it because this was in a completely different star system? Is it because it would potentially be a combat mission? Leer shook his head and tried to keep his thoughts on the mission objectives and focus on the Jump. He was hustled with twenty-one other soldiers, fifteen privates, three corporals, two sergeants, and one lieutenant. The private assembled with the other units in a large bay next to the docking platforms. The door sealed behind them as the troops all lined up on the SAMS Staging Platform and stood spread eagle. A neon blue biometric scanner ran from the top of the head to the bottom of the feet, flashed a green confirmation light, and correctly identified the Private as Mark Leer. SAMS stands for “Spacebourne Advanced Mechanical Suit” which a complex piece of battle armor that is designed for High Altitude Jumps and Extractions.  “Clank!” a hydraulic press clamped a pair of armored boots to the feet of Private Leer locking him into the staging platform. Leer’s aerogel interlink jumpsuit allowed the pieces of the SAMS to match up for assembly. Next, the gauntlets were added, then suit, and plate armor. The pieces extended and sealed seamlessly to prevent the suit from compromising in a Jump. The SAMS’s Neurolink, an artificial nerve core, connected to the interlink jumpsuit which linked to the neurolink inside the Trooper’s nervous system. Along with some bioengineering, this system allowed the soldier to operate the mechanical suit as if it were an extension of his body. This engineering made them much stronger physically and more resilient to stressors on the body. Now in the SAMS devastating traumas to the body such as high-velocity impacts were greatly reduced. Leer felt volts of electricity running through his nervous system as the digital combat system activated. A series of small probes and tubes were injected into his body converting his organic body to his cybernetic body that artificially ran his organs and muscles while the SAMS operated. The pumps and circuits would keep his body alive and prevent any unwanted natural reactions from occurring that would put the mission at risk. Things such as g-LOC would be a catastrophe during a mission so the body is run artificially. Leer was concerned about how that would affect his health until he went through MEPS and found out that they would be engineering his body to handle all this. The civilians typically don’t have this done and just stick to the embryonic DNA manipulation in their infancy.",1651423472.0,lit,20305558,2915,492
"Leer felt his face droop and a string of drool ran down his chin as his body shut down. This was not the most elegant part of the assembly and was also the reason for the urethra tube. The early researchers of this product realized that it was imperative to mission success for the operators to drink a laxative the night before a mission. Just as everything was going dark a zap surged through his basal ganglia. “Neuroplug active,’ Leer stated out loud to make sure his motor skills were functional. Then the endorphins released and he felt like he was on top of the world…. Well, he was in this case because suddenly the platform disappeared and he was falling. There was nothing under him except his fellow Spacebourne and the large cloudy red sphere known as Factorium.“Shape up!” the call from the sergeant instinctively triggered the private to snap into focus and he rotated head down into a headlong dive. Just as the group entered space they hit a magnet accelerator which launched them into Factorium ’s thermosphere. Here this one second was the best part of the Jump the weightless wonder and beauty of the black space backdrop right before sheer terror. The binary star system split the darkness with refracted light giving the approach a radiant gleam of immense beauty. The twenty-one troops guided themselves into a spearhead formation and the second sergeant navigated the patrol into the re-entry corridor. The SAMS radar system kept the units evenly distributed so that they would not collide and then “CRACK!” the atmosphere began to tear apart. A sonic shock blasted in front of the divers as they reached speeds of over , mph. “This is insane!” Leer thought then everything went red as they shredded Factorium’s high pressure atmosphere. It was easily hundreds of earth atmospheres and really put the SAMS to the test. Well, not really for the suits were made of composite materials that were light but as durable as titanium and beryllium. In the seals were mesh made of baron nitrate so even with the charged plasma encasing the suit it held fast. “I can’t see shit!” one of the private’s comm’d. “Switch to instrument readings if your optics aren’t adjusting.” Leer could only see red and orange tearing apart the sky around him until his optics filtered out that color. Now it was mostly white and yellow in the clouds below but there were black outlines of the plasma swirling part him. He could now see the other soldiers in front of him. His placement was on the rear starboard side of the grouping perfectly aligned. “This suit is truly a piece of wonder!” Private Leer thought as he glided through the amber sky.",1651423537.0,lit,20305558,2644,460
"As they entered Factorium ’s troposphere a thick blanket of cloud coated the landing zone. The optical filters shifted to a simulated rendering of the landing based on microwave data. Though the optics didn’t fully cut out the sulfuric clouds and the occasional lightning which would cause the rendering to pixelate for a split second. This was just a part of the microwave radar interference; the SAMS system had plenty of other metrics to assess the landing if the simulation cut out completely. A motto in the Engineering Corp was “For every sensor have three to back it up.”“Break!” the Leautinet’s first command was sent over the comm. Private Leer stayed on his path the only person who had to do anything was the squad leader who would send out a neural command to the interlink. This link would allow the suit to automatically set up the formation sequence. It took about five seconds and the spearhead formation turned into three arrowhead formations. As soon as they made the change they broke through the clouds and they were about five thousand feet above a maze of pipelines, massive electricity cords, slag heaps, building equipment, cranes, etc. There was no visible dirt and the only liquid was a chasm of molten steel.“On me!” Private Leer’s squad leader called out rolling right. In the briefing, the Captain discussed how the Jump would split up and each squad would go to the different landing pads in what is referred to as Drainage City. On Leer’s landing sim they were about a dozen miles from the landing zone. “Engage shoulder thrusters!” Squad Leader Sergeant Soloman shouted and Leer sent the command via neurolink. A second later everyone’s shoulder mounted thrusters engaged, firing an intense blast of supersonic gas flow. The squad shot up between two massive thousand meter radio towers. Then they rotated from a head first dive to a standard landing position with feet down head up. The thrusters slowed their descent toward the ground until about fifty feet up. They cut off and the suits fell to the ground all seven landing on their feet. Though the landing strip was made for much larger crafts and made of strengthened concrete it still cracked a great deal from the landing showing a lack of upkeep.",1651423586.0,lit,20305558,2238,382
"The sergeant accessed the area while the privates checked each other’s suits for possible damage. Private Leer was checking Private Angelo’s shoulder pad which seemed to have a slight discoloration from the entry plasma. A small crab-like creature skittered by its carapace was made of iron. “Alright listen up while our suits run diagnostics and sensors augment to Factorium ’s planetary specs. Let’s go over our mission objects and potential hazards!” Sergeant Solomon lectured as corporal Locknar patted Private Leer and Angelo on the shoulders gently gently guiding them toward the conversation. Leer knew Locknar well enough to know he had a toothy grin under his visor. ‘The major focus of our section of the mission is to recover the HyperTech Crate numbered A- in the materials warehouse about a dozen klicks north of this location. That’s our primary objective. Our two secondary objectives will be the focus of the two other squads. We will contribute to them as needed but not over the primary objective. Private Macintosh what were the other two objectives?Private Macintosh was the only female in D-Squad and one of three females in the whole company. Macintosh was the paragon of the tomboy concept that men have worshipped for millennia. Private Leer’s sophomoric crush on Macintosh started when he signed up for the Space Force after graduation. He was walking out of the recruiters office when she appeared like something out of a movie. She wore a white sundress that was accented by her dark tan skin that was lighter around her well exercised shoulders and neck. This was probably from where she wore her team swimsuit during practice. She had long choppy black hair and large oval olive eyes that seemed to radiate wonder. She did not normally smile but had sort of a permanent smirk which told the world that she could not be beaten. Private Leer remembered holding the door open for an abnormal amount of time as she made her way over to him. “Thank you, Leer!” she said with a surprisingly sincere smile and walked inside. The next time Leer saw her was in bootcamp with military regulation hair and beating him in the push-up drills. Any hopes dashed for a relationship because of strict rules against dating within units.",1651423617.0,lit,20305558,2247,379

The ship was typically a Massive B Class model that is upwards to five hundred kilometers long and a series of conveyors bring trains of storage containers to the space elevator to where the containers are lifted and loaded onto the cargo loader.

Often he would explain the functionality of the suit better than the instructors and was an asset for Sergeant Soloman who preferred other people explaining the finer details. Thus the squad continued north on the two mile long landing platform following a quite faded white line about two strides thick. The area in front of them was a sprawling city of warehouses and assembly factories. Factorium has an extremely low number of non-robotic sentient life due to it being a massive planetary resource manufacturer.The robots and droids here are self-sufficient, able to conduct troubleshooting and repairs themselves. Technically they do receive an orbital cargo loader once a day at one of their six space elevators. The ship was typically a Massive B Class model that is upwards to five hundred kilometers long and a series of conveyors bring trains of storage containers to the space elevator to where the containers are lifted and loaded onto the cargo loader. Private Leer gauged his surroundings and noticed a large conveyor belt running fifty to a hundred foot containers northwest in the direction of the closest elevator.",1651423775.0,lit,20305558,2623,430
"The squad had reached the end of the landing platform. Sarge and the corporal were arguing over whether to walk along the conveyor or to traverse on the large pipe system. Naturally, there were no roads, hell, roads on highly populated planets are becoming obsolete. Robots do not need to travel outside their designated area of work and droids have the ability to levitate. The agreement between the Sarge and Corporal was to take the high ground on the industrial pipeway instead of the conveyor so we could maintain a better visual. After some quick reconnoitering Private Angelo found some pegs that could be used to climb up to the pipes. “Wow that's unexpected,” PFC Smart comm’d from the top. “There is a walkway up here.” Private Leer struggled to place Smart’s unique accent. It was probably a martian dialect because the “r” sounds modulated in an inflection. “Man, a tube would be peachy right about now.” Macintosh remarked as she got to the top of the rudimentary ladder. “Technically we are using a tube eh Textbook?” Cosca reached out to pull Leer up jovially.“Oh you’ve been studying, Cosca?” Leer grabbed his hand and clambered up onto the steel gangway.The Sarge trudged back toward the assembling squad. “What are you ladies jabbering about?”“Sarge, what do you mean by ladies? I take it as a great insult to my gender to have these chuds representative of my people.” Macintosh was clearly being facetious to let the Sarge know the privates were bullshitting.“Oh I’m sorry is the First Sergeant too offensive? We are known for our polite and mild mannered behavior, please don't report me to the CO.” Sarge’s gravelly voice made his sarcasm sound more like a threat.“Oi, Cakes leave the Sarge be. You’ll trigger him.” Corporal Lockner chided. “Cakes” was Macintosh’s nickname she earned when they found a slice of cake in her duffel during inspection. The squad shaped up and began heading toward the objective walking along the pipelines. After about twenty minutes of walking they passed a brick factory with dirty translucent glass. Private Leer, who had a tendency to become over involved with studying his environment looked a little more carefully into the dirty window. “Hey Sarge, There appear to be robots in here should I take a closer look?” The Sarge came over and Leer pointed down at the robots moving to and forth in their stations.",1651423846.0,lit,20305558,2367,401

"“Yes PFC Smart and Private Macintosh go with Private Leer. Meet us at the primary objective at  hrs.”Leer squatted down in the suit, the dirt crunching below his boots. With a quick motion he punched through the window and pushed the jagged glass edges out to create an opening. The bits of glass fell twinkling, showering the storage lockers below. The Sarge and the rest of the squad continued on north following the pipes. Leer hopped through the new entry and landed about twenty five feet later followed by Smart and Macintosh. Leer stood up properly and surveyed the scene and what he saw caused his eyes to widen. “What is it?” Smart asked, concerned as he watched Leer look around frantically. Leer leaped over a stack of metal rod and hit a button mounted on the wall. It was the emergency shut down button. “What are you doing?” demanded Smart.“This is a munitions factory they are building ion charged railguns!”Smart stood up right and looked around more carefully. Those metal rods Leer had leaped over were actually barrels and the large chamber toward the back glowed with a neon light with the Danger Charged Particles label on the sealed vault door.“This is a violation of the Local Group weapons ordinance under the MUR (Monoplane Universal Regulations). No non-MUR compliant factories are allowed to produce ion weapons, period. This is exactly what the briefing told us to find and report on.”“Hold up how do you know all this? You are just a green private fresh out of BCT.” Macintosh, interested more in the robots in the room walked over and began inspecting their profiles and avoided the increasingly tease conversation.“My father is a banned weapons legal expert at the Federal University on Earth. It’s just an area I am extremely familiar with.”“Well I guess I am a bit impressed to be honest just surprised. Just consult me before you rush into doing something in the future.”“Hey guys you might want to come look at this…”Smart looked over to Macintosh who was pointing at one of the robots. It was a standard robot for this side of the galaxy a MD- due to their ability to move and act at one hundred percent efficiency under many stressful planetary conditions. It can function at up to -C and as hot as a million degrees celsius. So it can work in almost any temperature except on stars and deep space. “This says it was manufactured by Horizon… look”",1651423877.0,lit,20305558,2384,415
"Sure enough in bright orange and brown slanted block text the Horizon Logo was on the inside manifold of the profile cage. Macintosh pushed the grey button under the micro monitor. A series of coded letters and numbers filled the screen. Status: Deactivated Operational Specs: Default Model Number: MD-v“None of the readings indicate that this robot has been tampered with,” Macintosh stated, patting the top of her helmet. “Horizon is implicated…” Smart muttered. “Shit wait are we not allowed to manufacture our own weapons? Isn’t that part of The Sun Sovereignty Bill to protect against existential threats?” “Somewhat, we can manufacture weapons under the direct supervision of the Sun system’s General Assembly… but manufacturing weapons in a ungoverned resource development and mineral extraction zone is a major violation of the Milky Way’s Sedition Act and Galactic Ordnance as well as a sanctionable offense under the Monoplane Universal Crime Act.” “I would love for you gentlemen to continue your discussion on Local Group politics and policies but we're E-’s and E-’s. We need to report this and get back to the primary objective.” “D- to D-?” “ Go for D-.”“Hey we located a weapons factory with Hor-”A deep intense rumble shook the ground. “What the fuck was that?” Macintosh shouted.“D- to D- regroup immediately. Repeat regroup immediately.”“-” “Alright Cakes, Textbook, we need to regroup.”The trio burst through the exit door closest to them and ran out into the load platform. The sky had dense black clouds swirling violent like a torrent between stones.Leer looked at his doppler radar. “Doppler says there was a major pressure shift so dark cloud cover is to be expected…. But my local atmospheric chemical scanner is not giving proper reads due to all the air pollution.”“Fuck it, Let’s use the conveyors and skate to the warehouse. It's a clear shot to the warehouse.”Smart jumped down onto the large belt system followed by the two subordinates. As they fell two dual titanium and silica wheels extended from recesses in the lower leg of the SAMS. They made their way down the track until the massive warehouse appeared. “Delta-, this is Delta- we are closing in your location what are your exact coordinates.”‘Delta- do you copy?”Another massive rumble came from the west. There was clear smoke rising from the Alpha Squad’s coordinates. “Are we under attack?” Macintosh asked frantically as they jumped from the conveyor to the warehouse staging platform. “I don’t know…”",1651423911.0,lit,20305558,2497,405
"Leer had a terrible foreboding and activated his service rifle. Smart nodded and activated his as well followed by Macintosh. It was a SAMS issue mm rifle with an ion accelerator in the barrel that allowed the projectiles to be fired at an insane velocity. The SAMS rifle is much more compact than the standard issue because the recoil is absorbed by the suit versus the shoulder. The small group breached the front entrance following the Sarge’s tracking blip. “It looks like they are in the back, Delta- to all units radio check.”No response.“What the fuck?” Smart said as he led the group toward the back.“Delta- to Control” “Control reads you loud and clear. Send your traffic.”A bright red glow flashed then Smart dropped to the ground. Before Macintosh or Leer could register what happened another red flash caused Macintosh to crumple. Leer dove behind a stack of crates. “Control to Delta- state your traffic.”“Delta- is under attack, repeat we are under attack. Two down.”“Control to Delta- abort mission repeat abort mission. Major signal breaches we are unable to determine……”The comm went to static. More red flashes lit the dim warehouse causing it to glow red. Leer shot a smoke grenade from his forearm launcher and let it fill the area with smoke then he scrambled over to his two colleagues. He felt sick as he saw that Smart had been shot in the head and Macintosh was shot in the throat. He pushed their retrieval beacons and manually activated their abort sequence.",1651423942.0,lit,20305558,1485,253
"Then Leer made a break for the closest wall. He burst through like a juggernaut but was tripped up by something. He fell face first nearly being hit by the red laser beam. He rolled sideways and used the wall as temporary cover. He studied his surroundings for a means to escape. Two loud crashes rang out and then a horrible shriek. The automatic abort launch sequence had activated and his two fallen comrades ascended to the Battle cruiser EFA Eisenhower. He watched their SAMS move and operable automatically creating an ephemeral sense of anxiety as two more laser shots were fired off toward the fleeing bodies. “Fuuuuuck,” Leer felt then a surge of emotional turbulence inside him bubbling. He was isolated in a hostile world. It would be pretty reckless to just abort here, but I am pinned down. Leer looked around but his eyes focused on a metal box right where he had fallen. “A-” was embossed on the side with large bold print and was painted in yellow. “Sometimes things just fall into place….” Leer lounged for the box with a revived understanding of what exactly he must do. It was a very simple plan, one without a lot of thought, but when it came down to it there was any other choice. Grabbing the box he pressed his launch button and started running. The hip thruster spat out a stream of flaming chemicals shooting him up violently. The red came from behind like he expected and he was able to avoid it but the one in front of him did not miss. It shot straight through the box and into the Private’s chest. It was not a laser that hit him that’s all he could process. The dual trapezius scramjets shrieked as they engaged. Leer’s mind was getting foggy, but he was not feeling pain due to the neural plugs controlling his pain reception. The right side of his suit began to malfunction and his hand released the eight hundred pound box causing it to swing out. Both fortunately and unfortunately his left hand never released the crate. Unfortunately because this caused Leer to start spinning like a spade drill bit. The dual scramjet mitigated the speed at which he spun, which was slightly more fortunate, but then his body regulation system began failing and everything went black. end chapter",1651423972.0,lit,20305558,2216,394

"“That is absolutely mad!” Elder Tamor cried to his fellow members of the High Council. “We can not permit this, hell even considering it would turn the Kingdom against us!”“What do you propose we do then?” Elder Blackamore retorted. “The Oracle was clear that we are to find the Marked Ones.”“Yes, but there can be no disputing that the Oracle is clearly referring to the Princess, his only child and heir to the throne!”Elder Blackamore pursed his lips in thought.“Elder’s please we just received the information, let us hear the transcription from the High Priest once more before we deliberate,” Head Elder Linom mediated. “If the High Priest could restate the Oracle’s message once more for the council, you may start now.” “Ehem, I, High Priest Zaphin of the House of Prophecy and Scribe Principle, do attest that these words are exactly spoken by the Oracle. I was a primary witness in the Chamber of the Monolith when Oracle spoke to the Supreme Bishop. What was stated and I quote, ‘On the Eve of the Libal Moon ten and seven cycles past, the Marked were born here at last. The Tricael altering, the borders seeping, darkness from the other realms are leaking. Astra’s trials and tribulations will shake the future of The Jacom nation. Darkness bleeds in the North Seas and from the south your enemy leads. As Astra and Liber collide, you must throw the marked ones into the divide.”“It wouldn’t be prudent if the Oracle just gave us the information in plain Jaconian,” snorted Elder Patyr stroking his long gray beardHead Elder Linom held his hand up for silence. “Thank you High Priest Zaphin you may wait in the hall, and if the need arises you will be summoned again. Our servants will tend to any requests you may have, and enjoy your stay.”The skinny bifocaled man bowed respectfully and departed the room. The High Council consisted of seven elders hailing from different regions of the Jacom Kingdom. The silence held by the Head Elder was deafening; it was clear at least two of the seven elders were in a state of suspended animation.“First things first,” the Elder mused. “We need to decipher this message. I am sure that is clear, but it is important that we review our records prior to any snap decisions. Please, and mind you one at a time, clearly your immediate concerns if you have any.”There was a pause, and when no one spoke, Elder Timor cleared his throat, “A marked one is someone who possesses a sigil of unknown origin typically at birth. They are practically unheard of though there are factions of the Order of Liber Nile who tattoo such symbols to their persons. However again the markings the Marked ones have are reported to have no known origin and are certainly not tattoos. The only known marked one in the kingdom IS the princess not only that she was born seventeen cycles ago just like the passage stated. -",1651427011.0,lit,20305558,2850,499
"-So unless there are more Marked Ones the oracle is solely referring to her.”Elder Ann, the only female member, wrote down the divination and pondered the implications of the words, “Are you certain there are no other marked ones?”Elder Timor scratched his head, “I cannot say yes, but I of all people would know as the Master of the Archives.”Elder Ann tapped her quill in a light tip tap as she looked at Elder Mako, Master at Arms. “Could you have them look into it?”Elder Blackmore spluttered you most certainly can not expect the High Council to rely on those witches. Elder Ann expected no less from the newly appointed Elder Blackmore, the Ambassador of the Church of Lum. She was surprised he waited so long to interject after his short dispute with Elder Timor. “Elder Blackmore, I understand your concern, but they are not witches nor are they affiliated with the Order. They do things in ways that are opposed to our tenets..”“They practice open sorcery and occult rituals; they are just as demonic as the Liber Nile!” Elder Blackmore shouted.“Elder Blackmore, I do not like your hostility toward a fellow councilor,” Head Elder Linom stated with an air of impending doom around his rather nonchalant demeanor. Elder Mako simply nodded and in a gruff voice, “I’ll see what’s what with the matter.”“I heard a rumor when I was overseeing the recent construction of a new bridge at the Verglaskeep in the Azuth Mountains. There was gossip among the troops that there had been a boy who would come to the keep with gold to buy supplies such as herbs or food. According to the men there, not only did he bear strange face markings but he was trained by Myō'ō in the spear.”",1651427048.0,lit,20305558,1679,295

"“I am sorry my men came up with such a fanciful tale.

They claimed he had a sort of what I could only assume is a type of spiral mandala marking.”The Head Elder nodded and then looked at Elder Mako.“I will have The Stitch look into the matter as soon as possible.”“If anyone else has any leads on marked ones you have full authority to pursue further info, refrain from overt hostility. As we all have heard about the murders in the south,” Head Elder Linom pressed his finger on his orbital in concern. “Reports of horrific attacks on people who stay out too late and even a few reports that some occurred within a township.

"At the German Institute this afternoon. Among those there was Celine. Tallraw-boned, strong, a bit ungainly, but lively during the discussion—or moreaccurately, during his monologue. He speaks with a manic, inward-directedgaze, which seems to shine from deep within a cave. He no longer looks to the right orthe left. He seems to be marching toward some unknown goal. “I always have death besideme.” And in saying this, he points to the spot beside his seat, as though a puppy were lying there. He spoke of his consternation, his astonishment, at the fact that we soldierswere not shooting, hanging, and exterminating the Jews—astonishment that anyone who had a bayonet was not making unrestrained use of it. “If the Bolshevikswere in Paris they would demonstrate it, show how it’s done—how to combthrough a population, quarter by quarter, house by house. If I had a bayonet, I would know what to do.” It was informative to listen to him rant this way for two hours, because heradiated the amazing power of nihilism. People like this hear only a single melody,but they hear it uncommonly powerfully. They resemble machines of iron that follow a single path until they are finally dismantled. It is remarkable when such minds speak about the sciences, such as biology. They apply them the way Stone Age man did, transforming them only into a means to slay others. They take no pleasure in having an idea. They have had many—their yearning drives them toward fortresses from which cannons fire upon the masses and spread fear. Once they have achieved this goal, they interrupt their intellectual work, regardless of what arguments have helped them climb to the top. Then they give themselves over to the pleasure of killing. It was this drive to commit mass murder that propelled them forward in such a meaningless and confused way in the first place.People with such natures could be recognized earlier, in eras when faith could still be tested. Nowadays they hide under the cloak of ideas. These are quite arbitrary, as seen in the fact that when certain goals are achieved, they are discarded like rags.",1651439798.0,lit,20307308,2104,353

"Reading books is passive consumption, you're literally reading someone else's thoughts.

This advice only boils down to: ""here is what you can do in a shitty society"", it's not wrong but it's extremely Jordan Petersonian ie to get your ""house in order"" while ignoring that the entire street is being carpet bombed. The Zizekian part of the equation that sometimes you have to fix the society before individuals can get fixed is almost always ignored and for good reason: it's impossible to piss against the wind as an individual. But we *are* at the point where we do have to look at entire society instead of solving issues at an individual level and sooner than later we will be forced into that position, the pessimist in me thinks that unfortunately the solution that will be forced on us, will be even *more* negative than the present state.

"I'm trying to figure out the difference in male vs female ideals of romance in order to write a romance that can appeal to both. This is what I've learned. men usually feel most loved when they are made to believe that a woman's love is not conditional in the cause-and-effect manner. Love is work for men, but it can be rewarding work when things are going smoothly and the woman is happy as a result. But the male romantic fantasy is to be shown that the woman feels the same way and stands by him when he's down on his luck, when the money's not there, or when he's not feeling confident. He wants to know that the love he believes he's earned will stay even when the actions that feed it wane (however temporarily). A good woman can often lift a man up in his times of need and desperation and weather the storm even when things aren't going well. The male romantic fantasy is an enduring and unconditional love that seems to defy this relationship of labor and reward. A man wants to be loved for who he is, not for what he does in order to be loved.This is the difference between a boy and a man. women often call this romantic entitlement. An entitled guy is a dude who maintains an unrealistic notion of men's typically active role in love. Before acknowledging reality, this boy uncompromisingly believes that he shouldn't have to do anything or change anything about himself to earn a woman's love; he wants to be loved for who he is, not what he does.All men secretly want this, but there comes a day when they eventually compromise out of necessity. After that day, they may spend years honing themselves, working, shaping themselves into the men they believe women want to be chosen by. A massive part of what causes boys to ""grow up"" is the realization that being loved requires hard work. This impetus begins a journey where a boy grows into a man by gaining strength, knowledge, resources, and wisdom. The harsh realities of the world might harden and change him into a person his boyhood self wouldn't recognize. He might adopt viewpoints he doesn't agree with, transgress his personal boundaries, or commit acts he previously thought himself incapable of. But ultimately, the goal is to feel as if his work is done.Can someone explain the equivalent for women? What is the women's fantasy of the ideal romance? What makes it unrealistic and merely a fantasy that it can't be applied to the real world?I don't read a whole lot of women's romance but I've noticed that while the women heroines in male targeted romances are expected to be beautiful, in romances aimed at women, the women aren't ugly, but there isn't a big emphasis or pressure on her to be very attractive. And the guy doesn't love her for her looks or her body, rather something else. Obviously her personality, but there's more to it than that that I can't put my finger on.Can anyone add to this?",1651387990.0,lit,20304665,2882,518

"Yeah, the thing you can‘t put your finger on is hope for reaching one‘s potential. Romance geared towards females often includes a kind of transformation story, an ugly duckling coming of age. The whole trope of a princess who lived in rags until her white knight in shining armor comes along, brings her home to his castle and gives her the opportunity to blossom into the stunning princess she was always meant to be. Same for stories like  shades of gray. In it, the male prot goes as far as to make the female prot sign a contract where he‘s in charge of her diet and exercise regime. This is the hope that a strong capable male comes along, scoops up the sad heap of woman they are and help them become who they actually would want to be. Kind, loving, beautiful, youthful, diligent, disciplined, generous, etc. most often, they prefer this plot twist to happen out of sight, iow, he‘s not actually teaching her anything or forcing her to do anything, he just provides her with the ideal circumstances to become her best self. Thus, the trope of that guy usually being wealthy for example. It makes it possible for her to lean into her feminine ideal, doing stuff like gardening and playing piano instead of having to pursue a career.",1651388832.0,lit,20304665,1239,222

"Men want someone who loves them unconditionally even if they are, behave and stay shameful. Women want someone who loves them when they are and behave shameful but who will help them overcome their shameful reality. They not necessarily expect a man to take away all their problems, at least not in more realistic stories that aren’t straight up fairy tales, but they hope he’ll be able to help them overcome them. That can be as subtle as finding a man who sees the potential in her and helps her find hope that she has what it takes to reach it. The trope of him just taking care of wverything might sound like a relief, that‘s why it‘s just a fantasy and should stay one. Because that would be as unfulfilling snd unsustainable as getting liposuction when you should go on a diet and exercise instead. There‘s pathetic weaklings in both genders and even more, we all probably go trough short phases where we just feel like we can’t take it anymore and we dream about someone coming along and pulling us out of the dark hole we’re stuck in.

"The basic female romantic fantasy involves two ideas:a) Pussy's market value is infinite. In other words, the most mediocre woman's reproductive facility is worth more than all the worldly goods that any man, even the most successful, has to offer.b) Although a mediocre woman is, by definition, not very different from dozens of others, an exceptional man may still fix on *her* specifically and henceforth be blind to all other women.The 'reproductive factility' consists not just of the capacity to have children (women get this as a default skill) but the capacity to care for those children. Therefore a female fantasy will tend to emphasize the heroine's character virtues associated with motherhood (kindheartedness, firmness, fidelity).Women's attitude to other women is ambiguous. On the one hand, there is a certain degree of solidarity in that it is in women's interest collectively to drive up the price of pussy as high as possible. A woman who sells it cheap hurts other women, and they will vilify her for it and call her a slut, a tramp, etc (in the same way that a strike-breaker in an industrial dispute is called a scab). On the other hand, women view other women primarily as competitors for men.Women desire the resources and security necessary for child-rearing; they also want their children to have the best genes possible. So they want, not just a rich man, but a rich and genetically superior man. (A woman doesn't really want an inferior man who has simply inherited wealth, for example.) Where the resources and genetic superiority are present in two different men, a woman's instinct will be to try to have the best of both worlds — i.e. marry the rich man (or use him as a sugar-daddy) and reproduce with the genetically superior man. However, this is obviously an imperfect situation for many reasons, so wish-fulfillment stories will tend to steer clear of it. It's sometimes covered, and usually the tone is pity for the adulterous woman, 'driven' into the arms of the other man by her stupid / weak / impotent husband who didn't understand her / give her enough attention / whatever. The Horse Whisperer and The Bridges of Madison County are fairly trashy examples; Lady Chatterley's Lover a more 'literary' one. The same idea crops up tangentially in Middlemarch. Dorothea Brooke marries Mr Casubon, but he, though well-off financially, is old and boring and can't give her orgasms. He dies, and leaves her his money in his will, but with the caveat that she will lose the money if she marries Will Ladislaw (the genetically superior but penniless man, who CAN, presumably, give Dorothea orgasms.) To be fair, this is a bit spiteful. But the important thing is that, from the female perspective, Casubon ought not to have done that, since it is the duty of an old, rich man (alive or dead) to give resources (directly or indirectly) to women so they can raise children.But this type of story is really outside our concern here.[]",1651405574.0,lit,20304665,2964,502
"In summary:A woman's basic fantasy is a superior man who has conquered the world and acquired large resources being himself conquered by her and giving her all those resources in return for her reproductive capacity. A woman's biggest fear is that such a man will desert her for another woman (either before or after marriage), so these fantasies tend to involve some rival figure — but crucially the man will have no interest in her at all. This is like a soothing cold compress to the feverish insecure female brow.Needless to say there are millions of unreadable trash novels which use the formula in the most banal way. But the more well-regarded titles aren't so different. Let's look at some examples.—— Pride and Prejudice (Jane Austen)Quintessential. Darcy is hyper-eligible — rich, youngish, healthy, intelligent, etc. Also — typically for this sort of story — he has a certain sternness of disposition. A woman wants a man who is basically ruthless to the rest of the world but gentle to her.Darcy falls hopelessly in love with Elizabeth, who is, objectively, fairly mediocre. Notice how the book doesn't have her jump at the chance, because although women are generally practical — i.e. mercenary — in matters of the heart, they don't like to think of themselves as mercenary and certainly don't want to be viewed as mercenary by the world. More often than not, therefore, these stories have the woman *rejecting* the powerful man over some moral or emotional scruple, thereby demonstrating — to him, herself and the world — that she is *not* mercenary. Obviously, however, she has to get the resources at the end.Notice also the 'other woman' character. Miss Bingley has designs on Darcy but she's a cow and he has no interest in her.[]",1651405649.0,lit,20304665,1748,296
"—— Emma (Jane Austen)A later book, and more subtle and complicated. Emma is already rich but the same basic desire applies — she still wants the most eligible man for herself. The equation is most nakedly apparent in Emma's scheme to arrange a husband for Harriet. Notice how Emma values Harriet way too highly and Harriet herself goes along with this valuation quite happily. (Left unchecked, a woman's instinct is to put an infinite value on pussy). This is all made explicit when Emma persuades Harriet to reject Robert Martin's proposal and Mr Knightly is furious and he and Emma argue about it. Mr Knightly points out that Robert Martin is more than good enough for Harriet and Emma says no he isn't. (Notice that Jane Austen herself clearly understands that Emma is in the wrong here. Intelligent female authors are not incapable of self-awareness.)Emma is only brought to her senses when Harriet sets her sights on Mr Knightly himself. Emma was fine with Harriet wildly over-valuing her SMV but this stops instantly when Emma sees her own genetic prospects endangered. An excellent example of the ""sisterhood/rivalry"" thing going on in the female sex as a whole.Feminists would surely hate Emma if they understood it. There's some sane & perceptive psychology in there.—— Jane Eyre (Charlotte Bronte)All the tropes from P&P are here in force. Jane Eyre is poor, (very much) not pretty, and not brilliantly accomplished (remember the scene where she plays the piano). But her qualities of character are exactly those which will make a good mother. Despite her superficial mediocrity a rich, powerful man falls for her.Then we have the 'rejection' thing where she leaves him because of moral scruples, even though it means poverty (literally almost dying of starvation — CB doesn't do things by halves, haha).The 'other woman' is there too in the shape of Blanche Ingram. She's very similar to Miss Bingley in P&P — cutting a brilliant figure, trying to charm the man. But he is most unimpressed with her, just as Darcy is only annoyed by Miss Bingley. (There's obviously another 'other woman' in the shape of the mad ex in the attic.)[]",1651405710.0,lit,20304665,2142,361
"—— Rebecca (Daphne du Maurier)Rinse & repeat. The heroine (narrator) is poor, plain, unaccomplished. Rich, powerful man falls for her (sort of inexplicably, but as usual, it's mostly because he's impressed by her essential goodness of character.)This time the 'other woman' is his dead ex-wife. So it's basically Jane Eyre (or, if you prefer, it's the story of what might happen if Darcy actually married Miss Bingley, then realized what a cow she is, and only met Elizabeth Bennett later.) Notice the very specific echo of JE in the mad ex-wife burning the house down (yes, in Rebecca it's Mrs Danvers who actually strikes the match, but mythopoetically it's clearly Rebecca behind it all).——  Shades of Gray (Grey?)Of course in terms of literary quality we just jumped off the edge of the Grand Canyon, but it's the same basic engine under the bonnet. Notice the emphasis on how OBJECTIVELY MEDIOCRE the woman is. She has literally nothing to offer except a) a functional uterus and b) a kind disposition, but that is enough for a man who could literally have any woman to fixate on her.I have only read two paragraphs of this and watched about four minutes of the film, but there's one bit which struck me as really the essence of the female fantasy. The heroine is sent to interview this mysterious billionaire and after she's asked him about two-and-a-half questions he's so mesmerized he gets his PA on the intercom and tells her to cancel some important meeting he has scheduled. That's the female psychological g-spot right there. Billionaire CEO cancels vital meeting because he met POOR LITTLE ME.Notice also all the same incidental tropes (she rejects him, he chases after her, there's a potential rival but he isn't interested in her, etc).—— Twilight (Stephanie Meyer)Same basic idea, obviously. MC is a bit of a socially-awkward ugly duckling but the powerful man inexplicably falls for her. Why? HE JUST DOES, OK?? The male lead is called ""Edward"", after Edward Rochester in Jane Eyre, IIRC. Women only have one brain; they just share it.[]",1651405772.0,lit,20304665,2055,346
"—— Gone With The Wind (Margaret Mitchell)Rhett Butler is the powerful and superior man who acquires vast resources (through blockade-running in the Civil War). He falls for Scarlett even though she's objectively not all that great. (The first words of the book are ""Scarlett O'Hara was not beautiful..."" Obviously Hollywood ignored this completely when they made the film, as they always do.) The difference here is that it's a semi-tragedy: Scarlett is actually misguided for too long (or almost — MM holds off from pure tragedy at the end, leaving open the possibility that Scarlett really will win Rhett back).—— Frankenstein (Mary Shelley)Her husband might indeed have helped her with the prose but I can fully believe that Mary came up with the basic story. It's not straightforward romantic wish-fulfillment, but it's a product of the same basic world view. The difference here is that Frankenstein is the powerful, capable man who (in the view of the female author) FOLLOWS THE WRONG PATH — i.e. he tries to go through life without a woman, and suffers disastrous consequences.This can be summed up very well by Mary's own comment on the book. She said ""It's the tragedy of a man who tries to have a child without involving a woman."" Enough said.Notice how many intelligent female authors are quite self-aware about the nature of relations between the sexes. Here's a passage from a short story called ""The Deluge At Norderney"", by Isak Dinesen:She had been brought up by a pious governess, of the sect of the Hernhuten, who thought much of female virtue. In those days a woman's being had one center of gravity, and life was simpler to her on this account than it has been later on. She might poison her relations and cheat at cards with a high hand, and yet be an *honnête femme* as long as she tolerated no heresy in the sphere of her specialty. Ladies of her day might themselves fix the price of their hearts and minds and of their souls, should they choose to deal with the devil; but as to their bodies, those were the women's stock in trade, and the lowering of the sacred standard price for them was thought of as disloyal competition to the guild of the *honnêtes femmes*, and was a deadly sin. Indeed, the higher a young woman could drive up the price individually, the greater was her state of holiness, and it was far better that it should be said of her that for her sake many men had been made unhappy, than that she should have made many men happy.[]",1651405873.0,lit,20304665,2473,436
"Men want someone who loves them unconditionallyPeople almost always say this, but what it truly is is a very uncharitable reading of men ideally wanting a relationship which is not a / power struggle, and in which they can let their guard down now and then.

The premise of his method is that if the woman ends up with a man who is in any way desirable, it must be a crypto-pulp-romance wish-fulfillment fantasy: if the narrative explicitly goes against this, openly condemns marriages without a proper moral basis, deeply engages with the subject and presents a complex treatment of it which takes into account the multifarious dynamics at play, well obviously all this is just an elaborate smokescreen to try and hide a vicious, animalistic impulse (which is also conveniently a very simple motive, thus relieving him of the nuisance of paying any attention to the details).

Please believe me when I say that like any drug, the chemical response that you feel about ""that girl"" will fade. I say ""that girl"" because we all know that ""she"" fades as well. Generally you catch these feelings, things play out, maybe you have some success and then maybe you fuck things up by trying too hard. That's what happened for me at least. Then comes the failure, and then the grief. You grieve for what could have been, and imagine scenarios in which you could have played things differently. You're not alone in this. We have a history of this feeling as men, and it's not just a modern phenomenon. I remember something a therapist had mentioned to me about some hopeless romantic from who knows what century who'd written about how he simply wished another man could go through the initial phases of these sorts of things and almost ""pilot"" him essentially. Anyways, back to my original point. That druglike feeling of vulnerability and passion has faded for me over time. Ironically, the older I've gotten and the less it has affected me, the more success I've had with dating. The whole adage about things coming to you when you stop looking has some merit. People have a sort of sixth sense for that, women especially. It's a riddle though, and one that's almost impossible to force. My advice is to live your life authentically and fail as much as necessary. Enjoy the ride, and enjoy that high, even when it comes with the lows. Also makes a great point. Don't allow romantic success or fulfillment to be the sole source of happiness or the foundation for what you think happiness is supposed to be.

"I’m only talking about the ones in the posts I replied to (Pride & Prejudice, Middlemarch). I haven’t read the others and can’t speak to them. The two in question are absolutely primarily about class, in different ways, but for both it is the primary concern. In Middlemarch, there is no difference in class between Dorothea and Casaubon; she is above Ladislaw in class and she renounces Casaubon’s estate to marry him. This may not be a counterexample since she is not entering into poverty for him (she is provided for out of her own inheritance) but she is giving up the added wealth from Casaubon, which she wanted to do anyway because the most important feature of her character is her class-related guilt, which is also a driving force in the romance plot, because the book is about class. The other two main romances also deflate the assertions made about the book, and the other storyline has nothing whatsoever to do with romance and is entirely about class (and religion, which is *also* more important than romance). Pride and Prejudice, while making points about relationships and the proper way for relationships to be conducted on both sides, is about true worth and the ability to find values which can reconcile the gentry with the up-and-coming middle class at the turn of the th century, and it is essentially an idealized fable where the marriage is the blissful result of the realization of the said worth/values, thus symbolizing the potential harmony of wider society when virtue is allowed to transcend class divisions.

"I'll preface that I don't read romance.While I do tend to agree with , I believe the argument falls apart when you consider anon's argument as too rational, academic, PUA-based and most likely unironically incel-cope (true sense of the word, not as an insult). While anon's argument reflects the real world—that women want a world-conqueror, that women wish to submit to a Man (capitalized M), that in modern erotica you see such characteristics of male domination and female submission throughout the erotica—it is somewhat different when you start thinking in Disney-esque fiction and fantasy. Particularly, the Disney-esque features the ideal female in an innocent female POV. Anon's argument is for the vast majority of females in a bell curve, but I can't help think that perhaps the ideal female in the innocent female POV is found at the fat-tail end of the bell curve.Thus, then, what is the equivalent for women in regards of OP's insight? I suppose the following for the fat-tail end of the bell curve:Women want to be helpful, be beautiful, and be mother-like. She wants to be helpful to her man because that is what precisely makes her feel like a happy little girl who is trying her best. She knows that she isn't particularly helpful, but to see her actions bring happiness to her man makes her feel happy too. She wants to be beautiful because there's a particular man she wants to swoon. While all the other men want her and already give her gifts, there is just that particular man who she alone just wants to swoon and to fall in love with. And she wants to feel mother-like for the same reason she wants to be helpful, but in the sense of being an adult.

"Born in Swansea, Wales, Dylan Thomas is famous for his acutely lyrical and emotional poetry, as well as his turbulent personal life. The originality of his work makes categorization difficult. In his life he avoided becoming involved with literary groups or movements, and unlike other prominent writers of the s—such as W.H. Auden and Stephen Spender, for example—he had little use for socialistic ideas in his art. Thomas can be seen as an extension into the th century of the general movement called Romanticism, particularly in its emphasis on imagination, emotion, intuition, spontaneity, and organic form. Considered to be one of the greatest Welsh poets of all time, Thomas is largely known for his imaginative use of language and vivid imagery in his poems.""Do not go gentle into that good night"" is a poem in the form of a villanelle by Welsh poet Dylan Thomas (–); it has been described as his most famous work. Though first published in the journal Botteghe Oscure in , the poem was written in  while Thomas visited Florence with his family. It has been suggested that the poem was written for Thomas's dying father, although he did not die until just before Christmas .",1651394141.0,lit,20304941,1181,200

"Retards on /lit/:Nietzsche was actually a ChristianMeanwhile, Twilight of the Idols §:It is quite justifiable to bracket the Christian and the Anarchist together: their object, their instinct, is concerned only with destruction. The proof of this proposition can be read quite plainly from history: history spells it with appalling distinctness. Whereas we have just seen a religious legislation, whose object was to render the highest possible means of making life flourish, and of making a grand organisation of society, eternal,—Christianity found its mission in putting an end to such an organisation, precisely because life flourishes through it. In the one case, the net profit to the credit of reason, acquired through long ages of experiment and of insecurity, is applied usefully to the most remote ends, and the harvest, which is as large, as rich and as complete as possible, is reaped and garnered: in the other case, on the contrary, the harvest is blighted in a single night. That which stood there, ære perennius, the imperium Romanum, the most magnificent form of organisation, under difficult conditions, that has ever been achieved, and compared with which everything that preceded, and everything which followed it, is mere patchwork, gimcrackery, and dilettantism,—those holy anarchists made it their ""piety,"" to destroy ""the world""—that is to say, the imperium Romanum, until no two stones were left standing one on the other,—until even the Teutons and other clodhoppers were able to become master of it. The Christian and the anarchist are both decadents; they are both incapable of acting in any other way than disintegratingly, poisonously and witheringly, like blood-suckers; they are both actuated by an instinct of mortal hatred of everything that stands erect, that is great, that is lasting, and that is a guarantee of the future... Christianity was the vampire of the imperium Romanum,—in a night it shattered the stupendous achievements of the Romans, which was to acquire the territory for a vast civilisation which could bide its time.",1651418834.0,lit,20306056,2069,327

"Nietzsche was actually a ChristianSuch peoples' Christianity is typically limited to sexual morality, respect for tradition and deference to authority, like most right-wing e-Christians. The problem for e-Christians is that these elements can also be found in Islam, ancient polytheism, contemporary Hinduism in certain forms, Buddhism, and more. They fail to acknowledge that which is unique about Christianity, namely, its concern for victims (I am following Girard here). In fact this is precisely what they rail against, in many cases. But railing against concern for victims is a hard sell in a formerly-Christian society especially after the moral event(s) of WW and Civil Rights/Decolonization.",1651420529.0,lit,20306056,701,104

He does say that women are deliberately manipulating men, trapping them, using them, yes. But he also acknowledges that they do so out of revenge for having been objectified and abused as mere means to get pleasure, on par with drugs, smoking, gambling and alcohol.

"This is the worst news possible short of him tragically passing or announcing flat-out that he's not going to finish. Last time the book got too big he split it into more books. That's happened twice. There is no chance he will conclude the story in seven books. His philosophy is to take the time he needs to make the story what it's supposed to be. He wants to finish in seven because it's a thematically appropriate number (he said this), but then he wanted to write a trilogy when he set out too. And he has now a decades-long history of failing to accurately estimate the scope of these novels.The final book should be tentatively titled ""A Dream of Conclusions"" because at this point he's lying to himself and thinking magically if he believes A Dream of Spring will provide enough space for him to write everything he needs to. He told us he won't sacrifice anything else he wants to do in order to finish the novels. He's actually said he feels sorry for people looking forward to them and expecting news. He has no attachment to it. He can justify to himself that the series had a conclusion in the form of the TV show, and now he's focusing on smaller projects he can assure himself he'll see through to the end. And he has no fear of the novels being concluded posthumously. So, everything is already concluded for him in a tidy manner. He will shuffle from this plane happy and with no regrets.Either he can't admit it to himself and he's subliminally communicating that it's over, or he has developed a resentment for the fanbase after decades of (justified) complaints.

Specifically, how these guys go from whatever Hegel said to a monistic history unfolding according to contradictions regarding class interests, thymos, or whatever else.Fukuyama sort of throws down the gauntlet at the beginning of The Last Man section of that book, basically saying that liberalism is fundamentally stable if we can’t identify further contradictions in it. I could probably think of some, but they don’t square with Marx or Fukuyama’s ideas so I’m curious what the actual nuts and bolts of these arguments are.

"Pertinent to your interests, many find Hegel’s Outlines on the Philosophy of Right (perhaps better translated as Philosophy of Law) more legible than his earlier works. It was one of his last, and presents his full theory of the developed liberal state.It’s helpful, though, to grasp the overall outline of Hegel’s thought, and where Objective Spirit fits into the System. Objective Spirit is the dimension or moment of human reality estranged from inner Subjective Spirit, which Philosophy of Law defines. Its development terminates in the notion of the rational State, which then becomes the essential substance of History, providing a medium in which subjects can develop their spirituality as Art, Religion, and in an ultimate moment of self-penetrating clarity, Philosophy as such. So Hegel conceives the political realm as . The sequence of states and their interactions that make up human history and . As an alienated world Man makes for himself, a Second Nature in which he discovers the freedom to develop Arts and learning.I would advise memorizing, at least in broad outline, the Triangles on Hegel.net before trying to read any of his books.

"So tell me about the ideologue-communist dichotomisation that marx would also be inferring. Does it make sense to you? to be an ideologue you must work from the premise that ideology stands above historical forms of social organization and that those forms are downstream from ideology. while Marx, in the paragraphs immediately following the one I cited, affirms the exact reverse:Does it require deep intuition to comprehend that man’s ideas, views, and conception, in one word, man’s consciousness, changes with every change in the conditions of his material existence, in his social relations and in his social life?What else does the history of ideas prove, than that intellectual production changes its character in proportion as material production is changed? The ruling ideas of each age have ever been the ideas of its ruling class. the reason why philosophy is in opposition to communism is because it is an _ideal_ reflection of the _prevailing_ social form, whereas communism is the _real_ movement for the _abolition of the prevailing_ social form.ideological affirmation/condemnation of something only means that that thing is either in accordance or in contradiction with the prevailing social form, which forms the basis of ideology. therefore: ) ideological charges against communism (""it's unjust"", ""it's not morally justified"", ""it infringes on universal human rights"", etc.) can only ever express the fact communism is opposed to the current form of society. but this is a simple statement of fact and can never rise to the level of an actual charge against communism, therefore it's ""not deserving of serious examination"".) conversely, communism itself can't be founded on ideology, and a communist can't be an ideologist, a philosopher, and so on, because something can't at the same time be in accordance (because ideological, as explained above) and in contradiction (because revolutionary) with the prevailing social form.And that's a cute little hypothesis you've got going there but I'm doing a PhD in a STEM field.I was stating a general rule, but maybe I hit on an exception this time and you were actually just born selectively retarded as opposed to the people who are turned selectively retarded later on in life. either that or you classify economics as STEM. or maybe you just spent too much time listening to sociologists or economists.

"Moldbug got ahold of Evola from the same source that /pol/ and /new/ did: Iron March infographics. They got ahold of him from the Pagan scene that had been reading him since he was alive and they were discussing this stuff with him in person. Here's Robert N. Taylor (lead singer for Changes) talking about being a White Nationalist Pagan back in the s/s. They were reading him back then.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqxMVMdkgMichael Moynihan (From Blood Axis) was also reading Evola back in the s before Iron March came along. A quick google search shows that he (Moynihan) was reading Evola sometime before  (http://drugie.here.ru/achtung/bloodeng.htm). The song itself was part of the Cavalcare la Tigre album, released in , which is a composite of various Militant Industrial and Neofolk artists's works. Annabelle Lee, of Blood Axis, also did her own translations of Evola's works and released them with Dominion Press (which appears to have since gone under; ""Dominion Press"" is also an unrelated Christian Fundie publisher), and Moynihan also edited two of these translations sometime before .

"whats the big deal about guenon?Rene Guenon is the most correct, smartest and most important person of the twentieth century. There was no smarter, deeper, clearer, absolute Guenon and probably could not be. It is no coincidence that the French traditionalist René Allé in one collection dedicated to R. Guenon compared Guenon with Marx. It would seem that there are completely different, opposite figures. Guenon is a conservative hyper-traditionalist. Marx is a revolutionary innovator, a radical overthrower of traditions. But Rene Halle rightly guessed the revolutionary message of each of Guenon's statements, the extreme, cruel noncomformity of his position, which turns everything and everything upside down, the radical nature of his thought.The fact is that René Guenon is the only author, the only thinker of the twentieth century, and maybe many, many centuries before that, who not only identified and confronted with each other secondary language paradigms, but also put into question the very essence of language. The language of Marxism was methodologically very interesting, subtly reducing the historical existence of mankind to a clear and convincing formula for confronting labor and capital. Being a great paradigmatic success, Marxism was so popular and won the minds of the best intellectuals of the twentieth century. But R. Guenon is an even more fundamental generalization, an even more radical removal of masks, an even broader worldview contestation, putting everything into question.- Aleksandr DuginGuénon undermined and then; with uncompromising intellectual rigour, demolished all the assumptions taken for granted by modern man, that is to say Western or westernised man. Many others had been critical of the direction taken by European civilization since the so-called 'Renaissance', but none had dared to be as radical as he was or to re-assert with such force the principles and values which Western culture had consigned to the rubbish tip of history. His theme was the 'primordial tradition' or Sofia perennis, expressed-so he maintained-both in ancient mythologies and in the metaphysical doctrine at the root of the great religions. The language of this Tradition was the language of symbolism, and he had no equal in his interpretation of this symbolism. Moreover he turned the idea of human progress upside down, replacing it with the belief almost universal before the modern age, that humanity declines in spiritual excellence with the passage of time and that we are now in the Dark Age which precedes the End, an age in which all the possibilities rejected by earlier cultures have been spewed out into the world, quantity replaces quality and decadence approaches its final limit. No one who read him and understood him could ever be quite the same again.- Gai Eaton",1651367845.0,lit,20301843,2812,441
"René Guénon defies classification. . . . Were he anything less than a consummate master of lucid argument and forceful expression, his work would certainly be unknown to all but a small, private circle of admirers.”—Gai Eaton, author of The Richest Vein“Guénon established the language of sacred metaphysics with a rigor, a breadth, and an intrinsic certainty such that he compels recognition as a standard of comparison for the twentieth century.”—Jean Borella, author of Guénonian Esoterism and Christian Mystery“To a materialistic society enthralled with the phenomenal universe exclusively, Guénon, taking the Vedanta as point of departure, revealed a metaphysical and cosmological teaching both macrocosmic and microcosmic about the hierarchized degrees of being or states of existence, starting with the Absolute . . . and terminating with our sphere of gross manifestation.”—Whitall N. Perry, editor of A Treasury of Traditional Wisdom“René Guénon was the chief influence in the formation of my own intellectual outlook (quite apart from the question of Orthodox Christianity). . . . It was René Guénon who taught me to seek and love the truth above all else, and to be unsatisfied with anything else.”—Fr. Seraphim Rose, author of The Soul After Death“His mixture of arcane learning, metaphysics, and scathing cultural commentary is a continent in itself, untouched by the polluted tides of modernity. . . . Guénon’s work will not save the world—it is too late for that—but it leaves no reader unchanged.”—Jocelyn Godwin, author of Mystery Religions in the Ancient World“René Guénon is one of the few writers of our time whose work is really of importance. . . . He stands for the primacy of pure metaphysics over all other forms of knowledge, and presents himself as the exponent of a major tradition of thought, predominantly Eastern, but shared in the Middle Ages by the . . . West.”—Walter Shewring, translator of Homer’s Odyssey",1651367906.0,lit,20301843,1941,309
"“In a world increasingly rife with heresy and pseudo-religion, Guénon had to remind twentieth century man of the need for orthodoxy, which presupposes firstly a Divine Revelation and secondly a Tradition that has handed down with fidelity what Heaven has revealed. He thus restores to orthodoxy its true meaning, rectitude of opinion which compels the intelligent man not only to reject heresy but also to recognize the validity of faiths other than his own if they also are based on the same two principles, Revelation and Tradition.”—Martin Lings, author of Ancient Beliefs and Modern Superstitions“If during the last century or so there has been even some slight revival of awareness in the Western world of what is meant by metaphysics and metaphysical tradition, the credit for it must go above all to Guénon. At a time when the confusion into which modern Western thought had fallen was such that it threatened to obliterate the few remaining traces of genuine spiritual knowledge from the minds and hearts of his contemporaries, Guénon, virtually single-handed, took it upon himself to reaffirm the values and principles which, he recognized, constitute the only sound basis for the living of a human life with dignity and purpose or for the formation of a civilization worthy of the name.”—Philip Sherrard, author of Christianity: Lineaments of a Sacred Tradition“Apart from his amazing flair for expounding pure metaphysical doctrine and his critical acuteness when dealing with the errors of the modern world, Guénon displayed a remarkable insight into things of a cosmological order. . . . He all along stressed the need, side by side with a theoretical grasp of any given doctrine, for its concrete—one can also say its ontological—realization failing which one cannot properly speak of knowledge.”—Marco Pallis, author of A Buddhist Spectrum“Guénon’s mission was two-fold: to reveal the metaphysical roots of the ‘crisis of the modern world’ and to explain the ideas behind the authentic and esoteric teachings that still [remain] alive.”—Harry Oldmeadow, author of Traditionalism: Religion in the Light of the Perennial Philosophy""René Guénon should certainly be considered a Master of our times. His contributions to the ""world of Tradition"", of symbols and of metaphysical teachings, are truly invaluable.""—Julius Evola, author of Eros and the Mysteries of Love: The Metaphysics of Sex.",1651368107.0,lit,20301843,2402,377

But a lot of the discussion about Guenon on here seems to be less about his politics and more about his metaphysics, often as an opposing voice against scientific realism, and in fact in his attacks on the quantification of everything in our society many far-right people seem to dislike him because his views go against their beloved racial realism and IQ tests.",1651397023.0,lit,20301843,687,124

"If you go on Guenon's wiki and look under ""influenced"" you'll find a lot of names, but I don't know any of them as being names that the alt-right invoke a lot.Indeed, that's mainly because those authors with whom Guénon had more in common, are usually not translated to english. In all of Guénon's books published during his life, there is not even one mention of Evola, while there are countless mentions of Fabre d'Olivet, Saint-Yves, Matgioi, Abdul-Hâdi/Ivan Aguéli and others.

"Vladimir Nabokov's Summaries and Commentary for Chapters –CHAPTER SEVENTEEN:When Don Quixote gets into a quarrel with the trooper of the Holy Brotherhood (highway police) he is hit on the head with an iron lamp. To cure his bruises he makes up the magic balm of Fierabrás, which he had committed to memory, consisting of rosemary (which is a kind of mint), oil, salt, and wine. It would be fine to try it. The description of the effect of half a quart on two different constitutions, Don Quixote and Sancho Panza, one vomiting, then sleeping and waking up much refreshed, the other suffering acute pains in the stomach, then vomiting and going into spasms and convulsions, without any sleep—this description is an excellent clinical observation. The oil, of course, was the chief mischief-maker.The whole chapter, with the blanket-tossing of Sancho and the ugly and lewd servant girl’s beautiful gesture at the end,* is superb.*[Editor's Note]: Sancho, suffering from his beatings but even more from the effects of the magic potion, “started to take a drink, but perceiving at the first swallow that it was only water, he stopped and asked Maritornes to bring him some wine instead. She complied right willingly, paying for it out of her own money; for it is said of her that, although she occupied so lowly a station in life, there was something about her that remotely resembled a Christian woman. When he had drunk his fill, Sancho dug his heels into his ass’s flanks, and the gate of the inn having been thrown wide open for him, he rode away quite well satisfied with himself because he had not had to pay anything, even though it had been at the expense of those usual bondsmen, his shoulders.”",1651078844.0,lit,20286738,1700,292

"CHAPTER EIGHTEEN:Don Quixote undergoes another attack of “strange madness” when he mistakes two flocks of sheep and the clouds of dust they raise for two mighty armies. Sancho protests:“Sir,” he said, “may I go to the devil if I see a single man, giant, or knight of all those that your Grace is talking about. Who knows? Maybe it is another spell, like last night.”“How can you say that?” replied Don Quixote. “Can you not hear the neighing of the horses, the sound of trumpets, the roll of drums?”“I hear nothing,” said Sancho, “except the bleating of sheep.”A device, whose use is very convenient to end the description of Don Quixote’s battles, is to have the mule-drivers or carters or herdsmen, immediately leave the scene, as here, when they see they have downed the madman by stoning him and knocking out some of his teeth, and perhaps have killed him. Another point of interest in this chapter is the theme of reality and transformation. Don Quixote even suggests a scientific experiment that would be conclusive evidence of the enchantment process.“Didn’t I tell you, Señor Don Quixote,” he said, “that you should come back, that those were not armies you were charging but flocks of sheep?”“This,” said Don Quixote, “is the work of that thieving magician, my enemy, who thus counterfeits things and causes them to disappear. You must know, Sancho, that it is very easy for them to make us assume any appearance that they choose; and so it is that malign one who persecutes me, envious of the glory he saw me about to achieve in this battle, changed the squadrons of the foe into flocks of sheep. If you do not believe me, I beseech you on my life to do one thing for me, that you may be undeceived and discover for yourself that what I say is true. Mount your ass and follow them quietly, and when you have gone a short way from here, you will see them become their former selves once more; they will no longer be sheep but men exactly as I described them to you in the first place. But do not go now, for I need your kind assistance; come over here and have a look and tell me how many grinders are missing, for it feels as if I did not have a single one left.”The vomiting that takes place shortly in this scene when Don Quixote once again resorts to the magic potion is a little too much of the good thing, especially after the slapstick in the preceding chapter. Knight and squire are now at a very low point.",1651079162.0,lit,20286738,2424,442

Those who wore the mourning, on the other hand, wrapped and swathed in their skirts and gowns, were unable to move; and, accordingly, with no risk to himself, Don Quixote smote them all and drove them off against their will [...]""All this is first-rate descriptive prose. We have to rely on the translator: It is a pity we cannot admire this in Spanish and thus enter into closer contact with the pure Castilian style.""Sancho watched it all, greatly admiring his master’s ardor. “No doubt about it,” he told himself, “he is as brave and powerful as he says he is.”",1651079351.0,lit,20286738,1064,181
"CHAPTER TWENTY:The sly art with which Cervantes alternates the adventures of his hero is above praise. It was absolutely necessary for the sake of artistic balance to have the knight gain a graceful and easy victory in Chapter . That procession had no business to go clad in Ku Klux Klan garb with torches and got what it deserved. This is the gist of Don Quixote’s observation to the young clergyman whose leg he broke. The reader is perfectly indifferent to the plight of the white-shirted mourners, and is pleased not only with Don Quixote’s abstract victory but also with the knowledge that Sancho Panza stole the rich provisions of the masked priests.Chapter  begins with an excellent scientific observation coming from Sancho Panza:‘It is not possible, sir,’ said Sancho, ‘that this grass should not betoken the presence near by of some spring or brook that provides it with moisture; and so it would be a good thing if we were to go a little farther, for I am sure we should be able to find someplace where we might quench this terrible thirst that is consuming us and that, undoubtedly, is more painful to bear than hunger.’”Both squire and knight have considerably gained in intelligence since we first met them. In this chapter we also have a specimen of Sancho’s story-telling capacity; the passage about the goats being rowed across the stream is excellent for its wit.(/)",1651079591.0,lit,20286738,1384,237
"A goatherd was going with his flock where his eyes would never more behold the girl who had been unfaithful to him. He came to the bank of the flood-swollen Guadiana River, which he could not cross.“As he was looking about, he saw a fisherman alongside a boat so small that it would hold only one person and a goat, but, nevertheless, he spoke to the man, who agreed to take the shepherd and his flock of three hundred to the opposite bank. The fisherman would climb into the boat and row one of the animals across and then return for another, and he kept this up, rowing across with a goat and coming back, rowing across and coming back—Your Grace must be sure to keep count of the goats that the fisherman rowed across the stream, for if a single one of them escapes your memory, the story is ended and it will not be possible to tell another word of it.“I will go on, then, and tell you that the landing place on the other side was full of mud and slippery, and it took the fisherman a good while to make the trip each time; but in spite of that, he came back for another goat, and another, and another—”“Just say he rowed them all across,” said Don Quixote; “you need not be coming and going in that manner, or it will take you a year to get them all on the other side.”“How many have gone across up to now?” Sancho demanded.“How the devil should I know?” replied Don Quixote.“There, what did I tell you? You should have kept better count. Well, then, by God, the story’s ended, for there is no going on with it.”“How can that be?” said the knight. “Is it so essential to know the exact number of goats that if I lose count of one of them you cannot tell the rest of the tale?”“No, sir, I cannot by any means,” said Sancho; “for when I asked your Grace to tell me how many goats had been rowed across and you replied that you did not know, at that very instant everything that I was about to say slipped my memory; and you may take my word for it, it was very good and you would have liked it.”“So,” said Don Quixote, “the story is ended, is it?”It was. The story that Sancho undertakes to tell is an old gag, however, probably of oriental origin. After this, there is again a scene in the coarse tradition of the day involving Sancho’s incontinence of the bowels, followed by the adventure, or rather the non-adventure, of the six fulling hammers (for grooving and spreading iron), which is rather lame.(/)",1651079846.0,lit,20286738,2411,456

"At this juncture, whether it was the cool of the morning which was coming on, or something laxative he had eaten at supper, or—which is most likely—merely a necessity of nature, Sancho felt the will and desire to do that which no one else could do for him; but so great was the fear that had lodged in his heart that he did not dare stir by so much as the tip of a fingernail from his master’s side. It was, however, out of the question not to satisfy the need he felt; and what he did, accordingly, in order to have a little peace, was to remove his right hand which held the back of the saddle, and with this hand he very adroitly and without making any noise unloosed the slip-knot which alone sustained his breeches, thus letting them drop to the ground, where they lay like fetters about his feet; after which, he lifted his shirt and bared his behind, no small one by any means.Having done this—and he thought it was all he needed to do in order to be rid of his agonizing cramps—he encountered another difficulty: how was he to vent himself without making some noise or sound? Gritting his teeth and huddling his shoulders, he held his breath as best he could; but despite all these precautions, the poor fellow ended by emitting a little sound quite different from the one that had filled him with such fear.“What noise was that, Sancho?” said Don Quixote.“I do not know, sir,” he replied. “It must be something new; for adventures and misadventures never come singly.”He then tried his luck again and succeeded so well that, without any more noise or disturbance than the last time, he found himself free of the load that had given him so much discomfort. But Don Quixote’s sense of smell was quite as keen as his sense of hearing, and Sancho was so close upon him that the fumes rose in almost a direct line, and so it is not surprising if some of them reached the knight’s nostrils, whereupon he came to the aid of his nose by compressing it between two fingers.“It strikes me, Sancho,” he said in a somewhat snuffling tone of voice, “that you are very much frightened.”“That I am,” replied his squire, “but how does your Grace happen to notice it, now more than ever?”“Because you smell now more than ever, and it is not of ambergris.”“That may well be,” said Sancho, “but I am not to blame; it is rather your Grace, for keeping me up at such hours and putting me through such unaccustomed paces.”“Retire, if you will, three or four paces from here, my friend,” said Don Quixote, without taking his fingers from his nose; “and from now on, see to it that you take better care of your person and show more respect for mine. It is my familiarity with you that has bred this contempt.”“I’ll wager,” said Sancho, “your Grace thinks I have done something with my person that I ought not to have done.”“It only makes it worse to stir it, friend Sancho,” Don Quixote answered him.what the fuck",1651082361.0,lit,20286738,2898,530

"April th: Vladimir Nabokov's Summaries and Commentary for Chapters –CHAPTER TWENTY-ONEThey see in the distance, on the highway, a man riding with something gleaming in the rain and the sun. Don Quixote demands,‘Tell me, do you not see that knight coming toward us, mounted on a dappled gray steed and with a golden helmet on his head?’‘What I see and perceive,’ said Sancho, ‘is a man upon an ass, a gray ass like mine, with something or other on his head that shines.’‘Well,’ said Don Quixote, ‘that is Mambrino’s helmet. Go off to one side and let me meet him singlehanded; and you shall see me end this adventure without wasting a word in parley, and when it is ended, the helmet which I have so greatly desired shall be mine.’The helmet that Don Quixote secures from overthrowing this barber, barber number two, was a barber’s basin which the man had put on his head for protection against the weather. The chapter ends with a lengthy exposition by Don Quixote of a knight-errant’s reception in a castle, in which Cervantes gives an admirable summary, without any extravagant caricature, of a typical romance of chivalry. “For every incident,” says John Ormsby, the nineteenth-century translator of Don Quixote quoted by Putnam, “there is ample authority in the romances.” It is a very lyrical and pathetic chapter, which should be studied closely.",1651148947.0,lit,20286738,1352,229

That the liberated prisoners stone him is as logical a result of his madness (he demands of them that they present themselves before Dulcinea) as their liberation was.",1651149167.0,lit,20286738,1500,265

(The theft of Sancho’s mount is an interpolation by Cervantes himself, but he did not correct later passages where Sancho Panza still has his donkey.) Now begins the adventure of the memorandum book belonging to the rejected lover, Cardenio, which they find. The manuscript is within the manuscript, for let us not forget that from a certain point (beginning with chapter  to be exact) the whole account is supposed to come from the pen of an Arabian chronicler.Leafing nearly all the way through the little book, [Don Quixote] came upon other verses and letters, some of which he was able to read while others he could not. They were filled, all of them, with complaints, laments, misgivings, expressions of joy and sadness, talk of favors granted and a suit rejected. Some were exalted in tone, others mournful. While Don Quixote was going through the book, Sancho was doing the same with the valise; there was not a corner of it, or of the saddle pad, that he did not search, scrutinize, and pry into, not a seam that he did not rip out, not a tuft of wool that he did not unravel, being determined to let nothing escape him from want of care and proper pains, so great was the covetousness that had been awakened in him by the crowns he had discovered, a hundred or more of them all told. And although he found nothing more, he still felt that the tossings in the blanket, the potion that he had drunk, the benediction of the stakes, the mule driver’s punches, the loss of his saddlebags, the theft of his greatcoat, and all the hunger, thirst, and weariness that he had known in his good master’s service, had been amply repaid by the finding of this treasure.(/)",1651149289.0,lit,20286738,1779,314
"Important observation: we know that Don Quixote is ready to turn any reality “no matter how drab” into a plumed and painted illusion. By now, however, reality itself is taking on the colors of the romance he has imbued it with. The story of the forlorn lover in this chapter has all the trappings of those very romances. Don Quixote, on this mountain pass, has reached a crag where illusion and reality merge. There can be no question of any parody of knight-errantry here.As the youth [Cardenio] came up, he greeted them in a hoarse, discordant voice, but very courteously. Don Quixote returned his salutation no less politely, and, dismounting from Rocinante, he gently and gracefully went over and embraced the young man, holding him tightly in his arms for some little while, as if he had known him for a long time. The Ragged One of the Sickly Countenance, as we may call him—just as Don Quixote is the Knight of the Mournful Countenance—after permitting himself to be embraced, fell back a step or two and laid his hands upon Don Quixote’s shoulders as if to see whether or not he knew him, for it may be that he was no less astonished at beholding the knight’s face, figure, and suit of armor than the knight was at seeing him. To make a long story short, the first to speak was the Ragged One, and what he had to say will be set forth in the following pages.(/)",1651149354.0,lit,20286738,1369,249
"CHAPTER TWENTY-FOURThe story of the Ragged One of the Sickly Countenance is told in this chapter and Don Quixote listens with professional interest. The youth is also called the “Knight of the Mountain” or “of the Wood.” Both are now firmly planted in reality, which has completely fused with their knight-errantry.‘My own desire,’ said Don Quixote, ‘is to be of service to you—I would beg you, sir, by all in this life that you love or have loved, to tell me who you are and what it is that has brought you to live and die like a brute beast amid these solitudes, for your person and your bearing show that the life you now lead is one that is alien to you. And I further swear, by the order of knighthood which I, though unworthy and a sinner, have received, and by my profession of knight-errant, that if you accede to my request, I will serve you in accordance with those obligations I have assumed, either by helping you if there is any help to be had, or by weeping with you as I have promised.’Note that Don Quixote has all his wits about him: when Cardenio begs him not to interrupt his mournful tale,This remark reminded Don Quixote of the story his squire had told him, when the knight had been unable to remember the number of goats that had crossed the river and the tale had been left hanging in the air.Cardenio raves about his love:Ah, good Heaven, how many letters I wrote her! How many charmingly modest answers did I receive! How many love verses did I compose in which my heart declared and translated its feelings, painted its kindled desires, feasted on its memories, and recreated its passion,etc., etc.‘And then it came about that Luscinda asked me for a book of chivalry to read, one of which she was very fond, the Amadis of Gaul—’No sooner did he hear a book of chivalry mentioned than Don Quixote spoke up. “Had your Grace told me,” he said, “at the beginning of your story that Señora Luscinda was fond of books of that sort, it would not have been necessary for you to add anything more in order to give me an idea of her superior qualities of mind,’and he proceeded at some length with titles he would especially recommend.As Don Quixote was saying all this, Cardenio’s head had sunk to his bosom and he gave evidence of being deeply lost in thought.[In fact, his madness had come back upon him.]Although the knight twice requested him to go on with his story, he did not raise his head nor utter a word in reply. Finally, however, after a good while, he did so.(/)",1651149716.0,lit,20286738,2495,456
"‘I cannot rid myself of the thought,” he said, ‘nor will anyone in the world ever be able to rid me of it or make me believe anything else—indeed, he would be a blockhead who believed the contrary—no, I am convinced that great villain of an Elisabat was living in adultery with the Queen Madásima—’“‘That,” replied Don Quixote in high dudgeon, ‘is not true, I swear it is not!’ And he turned upon him angrily as he always did in such cases. ‘That is pure malice, or, better, a most villainous assertion. The Queen Madásima was an illustrious lady, and it is not to be presumed that a princess of her high birth would commit adultery with a quack. Whoever says that she would lies like a villain himself, and I will give him so to understand, mounted or on foot, armed or unarmed, day or night, as he may prefer—’Cardenio was now staring attentively at the knight, for his madness had come upon him again and he was in no condition to goon with his story, nor was Don Quixote capable of listening to it, so disgusted was he with what he had just heard regarding Queen Madásima. A strange thing! but he felt impelled to defend her as if she had been his own lady, to such a pass had those unholy books of his brought him. Cardenio, then, being mad as I have said, upon hearing himself called a liar and a villain, along with other epithets of the same sort, and not fancying the jest, picked up a stone that was lying near him and let Don Quixote have such a blow in the chest with it as to lay him flat on his back.This is a masterly stroke on the part of the author! After fusing the illusion of chivalry romances with the reality of rugged mountains and ragged misery, he shifts gears to madness caused not by the emotions of characters in tales of chivalry (and both Don Quixote and Cardenio are such characters at this point), but to madness caused by the reading of such tales. Cardenio’s Luscinda, that tender abstraction, is replaced by a still more abstract abstraction, the Queen Madásima of old romances. The whole story of Don Quixote’s adventures has come back to its premise: pulp literature softens the brain. At the end of the chapter Sancho rushes to defend his master but is felled by Cardenio’s fist, and the goatherd suffers the same fate when he attempts to rescue Sancho. Sancho and the goatherd then maul each other while Cardenio escapes. (/)",1651149810.0,lit,20286738,2364,433

"April th: Vladimir Nabokov's Summaries and Commentary for Chapters –CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVEAs the knight and his squire ride toward the higher mountains the Madasima and Elisabat case is further discussed. Amadis is shown to be Don Quixote’s favorite knight,one of the most perfect of knights-errant.... he was the sole and only one, the very first, the lord of all those in the world in his time.Homer’s Ulysses and Vergil’s Aeneasare not depicted or revealed to us as they were but as they ought to have been, that they may remain as an example of those qualities for future generations. In the same way, Amadis was the north star, the morning star, the sun of all valiant and enamored knights, and all those of us who fight beneath the banner of love and chivalry should imitate him.Don Quixote means to imitate Amadis, as well, by playing the part of a desperate and raving madman.‘It strikes me,’ said Sancho, ‘that those knights who did all that had provocation and some cause for such foolish penances, but what reason has your Grace for going mad, what damsel has rejected you, or what signs have you found that lead you to think the lady Dulcinea del Toboso has been up to some foolishness with a Moor or Christian?’‘That,’ said Don Quixote, ‘is the point of the thing; that is the beautiful part of it. What thanks does a knight-errant deserve forgoing mad when he has good cause? The thing is to go out of my head without any occasion for it, thus letting my lady see, if I do this for her in the dry, what I would do in the wet.’The meeting with the lovelorn knight prompts Don Quixote to send a letter to Dulcinea. Sancho Panza finds out who she is in reality and here is her description:‘Aha!’ said Sancho, ‘so the lady Dulcinea del Toboso is Lorenzo Corchuelo’s daughter, otherwise known as Aldonza Lorenzo?’‘That is the one,’ said Don Quixote, ‘and she deserves to be mistress of the entire universe.’(/)",1651246763.0,lit,20286738,1916,338
"Nabokov anon, I await your chapter summaries",1651246786.0,lit,20286738,44,7
"‘I know her well,’ Sancho went on, ‘and I may tell you that she can toss a bar as well as the lustiest lad in all the village. Long live the Giver of all good things, but she’s a sturdy wench, fit as a fiddle and right in the middle of everything that’s doing. She can take care of any knight-errant or about to err that has her for a mistress! Son of a whore, what strength she has and what a voice! They tell me that one day she went up into the village belfry to call some lads who were out in the field that belongs to her father, and although they were more than half a league away, they heard her as plainly as if they had been standing at the foot of the tower. And the best of it is, there’s nothing prudish about her; she’s very friendly with everybody and always laughing and joking. . . . I’d like to be on my way just to have a look at her again, for it’s been a long time since I saw her, and the sun and air do a lot to the complexion of a woman who’s all the time working in the field.’And this is Don Quixote’s wonderful and noble and absolutely logical answer:'For you should know, Sancho, if you do not know already, that the two things that more than any others incite to love are great beauty and a good name, and these two things are to be found to a consummate degree in Dulcinea; for in beauty none can vie with her, and in good name few can come up to her. But to bring all this to a conclusion: I am content to imagine that what I say is so and that she is neither more nor less than I picture her and would have her be, in comeliness and in high estate. Neither Helen nor Lucretia nor any of the other women of bygone ages, Greek, Latin, or barbarian, can hold a candle to her. And let anyone say what he likes; if for this I am reprehended by the ignorant, I shall not be blamed by men of discernment.'Don Quixote writes the letter in Cardenio’s memorandum book and Sancho departs on Rocinante (his own gray having been stolen by Gines de Pasamonte).(/)",1651246938.0,lit,20286738,1980,394
"CHAPTER TWENTY-SIXThe plot has gradually gathered its coils and develops something more than episodic interest. We are very eager to follow Sancho Panza to El Toboso. On the way he meets the village curate and barber and tells them,‘My master is up there in the middle of those mountains doing penance and enjoying himself very much,'which exactly sums up the case.And then, all in one breath and without stopping, he proceeded to tell them of the state that Don Quixote was in, the adventures that had happened to him, and how he, Sancho, was at present carrying a letter to the lady Dulcinea del Toboso.... But when Sancho put his hand in his bosom to search for the book he could not find it, and he would not have been able to find it if he had searched until now, for the reason that Don Quixote still had it, the squire having forgotten to ask him for it.Sancho forgetting the book and the letter is a charming stroke of genius. He delivers mangled parts of the letter and expounds on the riches that await him, Sancho Panza.He said all this with so much composure and so little show of judgment, wiping his nose from time to time, that his friends could not but marvel once more as they reflected how very infectious Don Quixote’s madness must be to have turned the head of this poor man in such a fashion.In order to persuade Don Quixote to leave the mountain, the curate proposes to disguise himself as a woman, the barber as her squire, and to beg the Don to accompany them to repair the wrong done her by a wicked knight.",1651247072.0,lit,20286738,1532,281
"CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVENThe plot now develops in two directions: we are anxious to have Sancho Panza and Dulcinea brought together, and we are also interested in the masquerade the curate and the barber undertake in order to get Don Quixote home. Sancho Panza, however, turns back and rides with the two.The curate is a good sport, and what bothers him is not that Don Quixote is doing penance in a rather unchristian and fantastic way, but that he is mad and should be helped and cured. As already observed in connection with the walling up of Don Quixote’s study, the priest’s actions (disguised as a woman, etc.) show that the good man had a merry streak of madness too.Don Quixote had not heard the end of Cardenio’s story, but now the two friends meet him on their way up the mountain and he tells of his loss of Luscinda to his friend Don Fernando. It is very curious the way a really romantic and dramatic sequence of events develops behind the backs of Don Quixote’s books, so to speak. The villain Don Fernando is a suitable match for our hero, who at the moment, however, is thinking of other things. Note how prettily the color and light scheme is worked in when Cardenio describes Luscinda at the wedding:She was made up and adorned as befitted her rank and beauty, as for a festive or ceremonial occasion. I had neither the time nor the presence of mind to note the details of her costume, but was conscious only of the colors that she wore, crimson and white, and of the glitter of the gems and jewels on her headdress and all over her robe, which, however, could not vie with the striking beauty of her blond hair, which was such as far to outshine the precious stones and the light from the four torches that flared in the room.",1651247156.0,lit,20286738,1740,317
"CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHTThe author realizes that his plot is like a ball of bright yarn being wound—he refers at the beginning of this chapter to the ""hackled [roughly cut, combed?], twisting, winding thread” of his work.A second romantically mad creature, Dorotea, disguised as a boy, is discovered. With Don Quixote, this makes three guys raving in the heart of the Sierra Morena.* Dorotea provides a sample of preciosity and long-windedness—the girl’s preamble can be boiled down to five simple statements. Note further the fancy coincidence, a feature of romantic tales, that Dorotea’s seducer is Fernando, the enemy of our friend Cardenio. Note Cardenio’s behavior when his Luscinda is mentioned: hedid no more than shrug his shoulders, bite his lips, and arch his brows as a double stream of tears poured from his eyes.Dorotea goes on with her tale to what sounds uncommonly like the strain of the “Beautiful Tennessee Waltz.” Cardenio has a pleasant surprise when Dorotea describes Luscinda’s wedding:It seemed that, after the cermony had been performed and Luscinda had given him [Fernando] her promise to be his bride, she had been seized with a violent fainting fit, and when he had opened her bodice to give her air he had found there a letter in her handwriting in which she stated and declared that she could not be his bride for the reason that she belonged to Cardenio—the name, so the man assured me, of a leading gentleman of that same city—adding that if she had said yes to Fernando, it was to avoid having to disobey her parents.Note how the Cardenio-Luscinda adventure is neatly spread over sixty pages (up to here) with interruptions leaving, first, the reader wondering what Fernando had done to Cardenio, and, second, what were the contents of the letter Fernando found on his bride. The only artistic and structural importance of these trivial interpolations is their effect on Don Quixote and upon the general development of the novel. I have already spoken of their connection with the books Don Quixote had read. Actually, there is not much to choose between Dorotea and the young lady you know so well, the one in tattered shorts with the pear-shaped tear and the below-sea-level neckline, Daisy Mae. But Dorotea and her like came first, four hundred years ago, in the infancy of European literature, and it is something of a pity that we have to view them against our will through the foolscap of today’s trite commercial concoctions.*[Editor's Note]: Nabokov appends the note: “mountain range in the south-western part of Spain; the highest peak is about , feet, and the parallel is between that of Philadelphia and San Francisco, if that means anything to you who have never been taught geography and have no sense of world figuration whatsoever. What land do you get to if you go straight north along the meridian of Rio de Janeiro? The tip of Greenland; you miss this continent of North America completely.’’",1651247407.0,lit,20286738,2938,492

"As I have stated earlier, I am doing a queer centric reading that explores how the western canon reverberates destructive waves of patriarchal repression throughout society and how the reality is many authors are crypto-allies that were forced to suppress their contempt of systemic male dominated cis-identifying transphobes and only leave subtle messages of support for the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, questioning, queer, intersex, pansexual, two-spirit (S), androgynous and asexual (LGBTQQIPSAA) community.In Chapter XXVI of Miguel de Cervantes' truly masterful pillar of western literature Don Quixote, Sancho Panza is sent to deliver a letter from the Dulcinea of Toboso on behalf of the valiant DQ. Sancho meets a priest who devices a plan to trick DQ into forgoing his penance and return to his village, notably this plan relives on a transappropriating crossdressing deceptive ploy that hints at the church's fundamental influence on the growth and perpetuation of queer peoples identities being slowly integrated back into societal consciousness after their unparalleled subjugation during the chivalric era.",1651275971.0,lit,20286738,1126,166

"I thought Don Quixote was remarkably self-aware in this chapter  passage, after Sancho tells Quixote Dulcinea is a simple, lowly girl:for all I want with Dulcinea del Toboso she is just as good as the most exalted princess on earth. It is not to be supposed that all those poets who sang the praises of ladies under the fancy names they give them, had any such mistresses. Thinkest thou that the Amarillises, the Phillises, the Sylvias, the Dianas, the Galateas, the Filidas, and all the rest of them, that the books, the ballads, the barber’s shops, the theatres are full of, were really and truly ladies of flesh and blood, and mistresses of those that glorify and have glorified them? Nothing of the kind; they only invent them for the most part to furnish a subject for their verses, and that they may pass for lovers, or for men valiant enough to be so; and so it suffices me to think and believe that the good Aldonza Lorenzo is fair and virtuous; and as to her pedigree it is very little matter, for no one will examine into it for the purpose of conferring any order upon her, and I, for my part, reckon her the most exalted princess in the world. For thou shouldst know, Sancho, if thou dost not know, that two things alone beyond all others are incentives to love, and these are great beauty and a good name, and these two things are to be found in Dulcinea in the highest degree, for in beauty no one equals her and in good name few approach her; and to put the whole thing in a nutshell, I persuade myself that all I say is as I say, neither more nor less, and I picture her in my imagination as I would have her to be, as well in beauty as in condition; Helen approaches her not nor does Lucretia come up to her, nor any other of the famous women of times past, Greek, Barbarian, or Latin; and let each say what he will, for if in this I am taken to task by the ignorant, I shall not be censured by the critical.",1651284304.0,lit,20286738,1925,367

"April th: Vladimir Nabokov's Summaries and Commentary for Chapters –CHAPTER TWENTY-NINEA continuation of the Cardenio-Luscinda-Fernando-Dorotea business. Cardenio says to Dorotea:I swear to you by the faith of a gentleman and a Christian not to desert you until I see you possessed of Don Fernando. If words will not bring him to recognize his obligations to you, then I will make use of that privilege which my rank as a gentleman gives me and will justly challenge him, calling upon him to give an account of the wrong he has done you, without taking thought of those that I have suffered at his hands and which I shall leave to Heaven to avenge while I here on earth see to righting yours.This is exactly what Don Quixote would have said. The parody of a gallant romance is completely lost here in a gallant romance itself, silly as it is. Life plays up to Don Quixote and his books, but while the windmills and innkeepers of the novel seem to us reasonably real, that is, true to the average reader’s conception of windmills and innkeepers, the lovelorn lad and lass we have here seem to us a product of the very thing—sentimental literature—that drove Don Quixote mad. I urge you to grasp this point.We now have Don Quixote on our hands. Very neatly Dorotea remarks thatshe could play the part of the damsel in distress better than the barber; and what was more, she had with her the garments that would enable her to give a most lifelike semblance to the role. All they needed to do was to leave it all to her and she would see to everything that was necessary to the carrying out of their plan, for she had read many books of chivalry and was familiar with the mode of speech that was employed by afflicted maidens when they sought a boon of knights-errant.We do not appreciate the subtle difference between her real plight and the plight of a damsel in distress in books of chivalry. It seems all one to us, and Don Quixote consequently becomes a real knight-errant, a real helper and avenger, since Dorotea is really a damsel in distress. For readers of the author’s day, beginning of the seventeenth century, the difference may have been more accented, since the main fact looming above all others was, to them, () the absence of ironclad knights-errant in the Spanish countryside, and () the presence of Fernando and Dorotea, and their love affair, in contemporaneous novels. Note how the curate performs the subtle switch from Dorotea’s own plight to a story that might appeal to the Don Quixote-Sancho Panza team. She, he says to Sancho,is heiress in the direct male line to the great kingdom of Micomicon, and she comes here in search of your master to ask a favor of him, which is that he right the injury or wrong which a wicked giant has done her. By reason of the fame as a worthy knight which your master enjoys throughout the known world, this princess has journeyed all the way from Guinea to seek him out.(/)",1651351313.0,lit,20286738,2930,522
"Note that Sancho Panza is in the plot to bring Don Quixote home in that he believes what the curate invents. The substitution of the giant-killing fantasy for the Fernando affair, with the victim of the latter acting as the victim of the former, is very amusing from the structural point of view. Don Quixote, we presume, might as willingly come to her assistance in her real predicament as related by her. The usurped kingdom she refers to is, after all, a plausible euphemism for her purloined virginity. The chivalry-book theme used to deceive Don Quixote is but a peg higher in the scale of absurdity, as we see the thing now. But the reaction to these absurd matters on the part of Don Quixote who, owing to the artistic and moral genius of his creator, is an artistic reality to the reader of any age—this reaction of his is human and divine and absolutely delightful and pathetic as all his gestures are, and this redeems the interpolations. “‘No matter who she may be,’ said Don Quixote, ‘I shall do my duty and follow the dictates of my conscience in accordance with the calling that I profess.’ And, turning to the damsel, he added, ‘Rise, most beautiful one; I grant you the boon you seek.’” At this interview between the knight and Dorotea “The barber was still on his knees, doing his best to keep from laughing and to prevent his [false] beard from falling off, for if that had happened they would not have been able to carry out their clever scheme.” But the scheme is not clever, and the matter is nothing to laugh at. What we suddenly glimpse is: a damsel in real distress and a real knight.(/)",1651351420.0,lit,20286738,1611,291
"The fanciful thoughts of Sancho Panza with respect to the Negroes, his fanciful vassals, are also not so fanciful as that. Mourning the loss of his ass, Sancho trudges along on foot as they leave the mountain,although he bore it all very cheerfully, being convinced that his master was on the road to becoming an emperor very soon; for there was no doubt that he would marry this princess and become at the very least king of Micomicon. The only thing that troubled Sancho was that the kingdom in question was in the land of the blacks, and his vassals accordingly would be Negroes. But for this he at once thought of a good remedy.‘Does it make any difference to me if they are black?’ he said to himself. ‘What more do I have to do than take a boatload of them to Spain and sell them for ready cash, and with the money buy some title or office and live at ease all the rest of my life? That is to say, unless I’m asleep and am not clever or shrewd enough to make the most of things and sell thirty or ten thousand vassals in the twinkling of an eye! By God, but I’d make them fly, the little with the big, or do the best I could at it; I’d turn the blacks into white or yellow men! But come. I’m making a fool of myself!’Occupied with these thoughts, he went along so contentedly that he forgot all about his annoyance at having to travel on foot.Many fortunes have been made exactly according to Sancho’s receipt, both in Holland and in the Southern States, and elsewhere, in the old days, by very commonsensical men. Sancho Panza is the grandpa of all tycoons.(/)",1651351483.0,lit,20286738,1567,295
"CHAPTER THIRTYA structural return to a former incident—the freeing of the galley-slaves by Don Quixote—is performed at the end of the preceding chapter and the beginning of this one, clinching the unity of events. The freed criminals are said (falsely) by the curate to have robbed him. Don Quixote blushes at first, but then makes a strong and noble remark, in keeping with his character:It is not the business of knights-errant to stop and ascertain as to whether the afflicted and oppressed whom they encounter going along the road in chains like that are in such straits by reason of their crimes or as a result of misfortunes that they have suffered. The only thing that does concern them is to aid those individuals as persons in distress, with an eye to their sufferings and not to their villainies.Another twist: It seems at first blush not very plausible that young Dorotea should join in the fun and invent fanciful stories about herself when she is in such emotional difficulties. The story she makes up is less fantastic than her real one.‘Fate has been kind to me and I have found Señor Don Quixote. As a consequence, I already account and look upon myself as the queen and liege lady of all my realm, since he out of his courtesy and splendid bounty has promised to grant me the boon of going with me wherever I may take him, and that will be nowhere else than to the place where he may confront Pandafilando of the Frowning Look, in order that he may slay him and restore to me those domains that the giant has so unjustly usurped. And all this is bound to come about, for my good father, Tinacrio the Wise, has prophesied it; and he also said, and put down in writing, in Chaldean or Greek characters which I am unable to read, that if this knight, after having beheaded the giant, wished to marry me, I was to give myself at once, with not the slightest demurring, to be his legitimate bride, and I was to yield him possession of my kingdom along with that of my person.’‘What do you think of that, friend Sancho?’ said Don Quixote at this point. ‘Do you hear what is happening? What did I tell you? Just look, we already have a kingdom to rule over and a queen to wed.’Two things are bothering the author: () the absence of Sancho Panza’s mount (a very unnecessary deprivation in the first place), and () the fact that owing to the complicated Dorotea affair and her joining in the curate’s plot to get Don Quixote home, the author has not had a chance to have Don Quixote and Sancho Panza talk about Dulcinea—a subject which logically should have been at the top of the mess in Don Quixote’s brain (though it may be argued that he is more interested in discovering Dulcinea as a fair vision in the mirror of chivalry than as a real person to whom one can send a message). By the end of the chapter the gray is back (due to a second-edition interpolation) and Don Quixote asks about Dulcinea and Sancho Panza’s errand.",1651351592.0,lit,20286738,2936,535
"CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE‘What was my beauteous queen engaged in doing when you arrived? Surely you must have found her stringing pearls or embroidering some device in gold thread for this her captive knight.’‘No,’ replied Sancho [making up the whole thing], ‘I did not. I found her winnowing two fanegas [three bushels] of wheat in the stable yard of her house.’‘If that is so,’ said Don Quixote, ‘then you may be sure that those grains of wheat were so many pearls when her fingers touched them. And did you observe, my friend, if the wheat was fine and white or of the ordinary spring-sown variety?’‘It was neither,’ Sancho informed him; ‘it was the reddish kind.’‘Then I assure you,’ the knight insisted, ‘that without a doubt, when winnowed by her hands, it made the finest of white bread. But go on. When you gave her my letter, did she kiss it? Did she place it on her head or accord it any ceremony such as it deserved? If not, what was it that she did?’‘When I went to give it to her,’ said Sancho, ‘she was busy swinging the sieve, with a good part of the wheat in it, from side to side. “Lay it on that sack,” she said to me, “I’ll not have time to read it until I have finished sifting all that is here.”Discreet lady!’ said Don Quixote. ‘That was in order that she might take her time in reading it and revel in it.’An important note of structure: Cervantes for the sake of keeping the novel together (it threatens to sprawl at this point), has the characters either recall past events or has characters from former chapters appear again. Thus on his errand to Dulcinea, Sancho passes through the village where he had been blanket-tossed. Thus the galley-slaves are mentioned by the priest; thus the robber who stole Sancho’s ass appears again in a gypsy’s garb; thus the lad whom Don Quixote had attempted to save from the brutal farmer clasps the good knight’s knees again. The continuation of these episodes along the main current of the story (which after all began with the bubbles of parody and then flowed on as an account of a pathetic and noble creature’s mad fancies)—the continuation and development of these episodes along the main current do give the story the kind of sweeping unity that in our minds is associated with the form of the novel.",1651351745.0,lit,20286738,2262,405
"CHAPTER THIRTY-TWOAt the inn at which the very mixed company stops there takes place an admirable discussion of books of chivalry—this is yet another subject that Cervantes with much skill brings to the fore to promote and preserve the structural unity of the book. What the servant girl Maritornes, a none-too-happy and none-too-handsome wench, has to say on this subject is worth quoting:‘I give you my word, I also like to hear about those things, for they are very pretty, especially when they tell about some lady or other being embraced by her knight under the orange trees while a duenna keeps watch over them, and she herself is dying of envy and fright. I say that all that is better than honey.’ [Note the orange trees and the envious chaperone.]‘And what do you think, young lady?’ said the curate, addressing the innkeeper’s daughter.‘I really cannot tell you, sir,’ she replied. ‘Although I do not understand them, I get a great deal of pleasure out of listening to them. The only thing is, I do not like those blows that my father speaks of; I prefer the laments which the knights utter when absent from their lady loves and which sometimes make me weep from sympathy.’‘Well, young lady,’ said Dorotea, ‘would you console them if it was for you that they wept?’‘I do not know what I should do,’ the girl answered. ‘All I know is that some of those ladies are so cruel that they call their knights tigers and lions and a thousand other nasty things like that. Good Lord! I don’t know what kind of creatures they can be, without soul or conscience, if they cannot give a decent man so much as a glance but leave him to die or go mad. I don’t see how they can be such prudes. If it is their honor they are thinking about, let them marry, for that is all the poor knights desire.’The whole conversation is very amusing.

The curate proposes to read it were the time not better spent in sleeping, but in the nick of time Cervantes remembers that Dorotea may not be in the right mood for sleeping:Ishall have my fill of rest,’ said Dorotea, ‘in passing the time away by listening to some story; for my mind is not as yet sufficiently calm to permit me to sleep when I ought to do so.’Thus encouraged, in Chapter  the curate starts to read the “Story of the One Who Was Too Curious for His Own Good” (often known as “The Curious Impertinent”). This triangle of the two friends Anselmo and Lotario and Anselmo’s wife Camila whom he seeks to test, with unfortunate results, is in the tradition of the Renaissance.

Regardless, sprinkling is just as valid.tell me you don't see one of the clearest prophecies of the OTI think it is worth keeping in mind here that the authors of the gospels did have particular motivations in mind when writing them. Matthew for instance was written with a Jewish audience in mind and a desire to 'sell' Jesus to the Jews as their messiah. Putting words into the mouth of Jesus in order to link him back to Jewish texts is to be expected. The new testament is filled with such examples, just look at the textual variants.there's a reason it's called prophecyA prophecy is only worth anything if it is fulfilled. By putting words in the mouth of a dead man, such prophecies can be retroactively 'fulfilled'.Isaiah is another book with very clear prophecy of Jesus ChristIsaiah is talking about the Jewish messiah. Jesus did not meet the criteria of the Jewish messiah.I was talking about the Salvation Army. pic related. Obviously the uniforms I'm talking about would look different, but this gives you the general idea of what a uniformed clergy would look like.That's why I gave you a rangeThat puts it within a few decades of the assumed later dates of composition of the canonical gospels. I do not deny that Thomas was written after them, however it is not a next that just appeared many decades or centuries latter like some tend to claim. If you were a kid when the canonicals were written, you could have still been alive when Thomas was.It was the pre-incarnated Christ, actually.Had you told the Jewish prophets that is who they were actually talking about, you probably would have been stoned to death. Every single one of them certainly considered themselves to be prophets of Yahweh.Regardless, as I reject the trinity this is not relevant.By what standard except the written teachings of the ChristYou do remember that I am composing a denominational bible with several harmonies in it right?

"Kings. This part spoke to me the most when reading the Bible. That night the Lord appeared to Solomon in a dream, and God said, “What do you want? Ask, and I will give it to you!”Solomon replied, “You showed great and faithful love to your servant my father, David, because he was honest and true and faithful to you. And you have continued to show this great and faithful love to him today by giving him a son to sit on his throne.“Now, O Lord my God, you have made me king instead of my father, David, but I am like a little child who doesn’t know his way around. And here I am in the midst of your own chosen people, a nation so great and numerous they cannot be counted! Give me an understanding heart so that I can govern your people well and know the difference between right and wrong. For who by himself is able to govern this great people of yours?”The Lord was pleased that Solomon had asked for wisdom. So God replied, “Because you have asked for wisdom in governing my people with justice and have not asked for a long life or wealth or the death of your enemies— I will give you what you asked for! I will give you a wise and understanding heart such as no one else has had or ever will have! And I will also give you what you did not ask for—riches and fame! No other king in all the world will be compared to you for the rest of your life! And if you follow me and obey my decrees and my commands as your father, David, did, I will give you a long life.”I think the reasons God is pleased with Solomon here are threefold. One, he did not wish for a result but for the power necessary to achieve a result. He didn't expect God to just make his kingdom prosperous, instead he was willing to shoulder the burden and ask for the ability to guide God's kingdom.Secondly, and more importantly, he asked for something which does not directly benefit him, but others. Lastly, he asked God for something that the Lord already had an interest in, as Solomon knew that God enjoys seeing Israel prosper.For this Solomon was greatly rewarded, and I think it holds a lesson on how to pray today. Pray for assist and abilities, not for results.Pray for others, not for yourself.Pray for the goals of God, if you know what they are.",1651242462.0,lit,20290322,2231,425

"This is a tough question to answer, and to preface it I will have certain biases and anecdotal experiences that influence what I say so take everything with a grain of salt.I'm nondenominational, I think every institution of Christianity is being eaten from the inside out but the Catholic church, historically, is the largest and most centralized institution of Christianity out there. As a consequence, the will of men, as it always is, was corrupted and power flowed into the hands of mortal sinners instead of towards God.Men built great structures and towering cathedrals because they believed it would please God. Men thought they could reform sinners through internal affairs. Men thought ritual and practice could enrich what the divine had already established. It is the nature of man to believe he can reconcile God's will with his own, rather than reconciling his will to God's. As a result, the CC, which once was supposed to act as the noble heart of Christendom, was slowly and carefully subverted by evil and corrupt means over many lifetimes.Does good still exist in the people of Catholicism? Yes absolutely. Are there practices prevalent in Catholicism that are worth keeping? Yep!Is the historical powerhouse worth remembering and honoring for the much good that it most definitely did? I think so. However, I think as the institutions of man begin to fall around us, there is no doubt in my mind that Catholicism, which was as I said, once the physical throne of Christian power on earth, will be yet another tool for Satan to help slide the world into darkness.",1651252048.0,lit,20290322,1582,266

Variations include British English, Deuterocanonical/Apocryphal texts including the Orthodox ones, a Catholic edition, and a Messianic edition with Hebrew names for God being used.Interesting to note is that its source text for the New Testament is the Byzantine Majority Text (mostly used by Orthodox) rather than the Textus Receptus (lines up pretty close with Majority Text for the most part, is the source for the KJV NT) or a newer scholastically used manuscript.Lastly, if you're alright with a Catholic translation, the NABRE is a pretty easy read and you can get a decent hardback copy for very cheap if you get the St Joseph's Student Edition NABRE hardback (about $), and there's an even cheaper paperback version (about $). It's a mixed formal and dynamic equivalence translation. The student editions include a whole bunch of historically/textually critical notes that lean mostly into a secular stance on a lot of things, so the notes are more academic than religious, but on the plus side it includes a bunch of pictures/diagrams/maps that are nice and is probably the cheapest bang-for-your-buck as far as money to reading content goes with the notes and deuterocanonicals.",1651253368.0,lit,20290322,1960,317

"I personally believe that Eve was God's last and greatest creation, thus women are the superior gender. I am not alone is this interpretation of the scriptures. The following is from “Declamation on the Nobility and Preeminence of the Female Sex” by Henricus Cornelius Agrippa, written in ;We know that, among all that was created by the best and greatest God, the essential difference consists in the fact that certain things live forever, while others are subject to corruption and change, and that, in the course of this creation, God advanced following an order that consisted in beginning with the more noble of the first group and ending with the most noble of the second. Thus, he created first the incorruptible angels, then the souls (for Augustine affirms that the soul of our first parents was created at the same time as the angles, before the body was fashioned). Then he created the incorruptible bodies, such as the heavens and the stars, and elements that, although incorruptible, are nonetheless subject to various changes. And from them he formed all other things that are subject to corruption, proceeding again by ascent, from the more insignificant through all degrees of humor to the perfection of the universe. Thus were created first minerals, then vegetables, plants and trees, followed by animated beings, and finally brute beasts, in order: reptiles, fish, birds, quadrupeds.Again after all this he created two human beings in his image, man first, then woman, in whom the heavens and the earth, and every embellishment of both, are brought to perfection. For when the Creator came to the creation of woman, he rested himself in this creation, thinking that he had nothing more honorable to create; in her were completed and consummated all the wisdom and power of the Creator; after her no creation could be found or imagined. Since, therefore, woman is the ultimate end of creation, the most perfect accomplishment of all the works of God and the perfection of the universe itself, who will deny that she possesses honor surpassing every other creature?",1651408218.0,lit,20290322,2082,345

For it to be true, you'd have to say that either St. John the Evangelist, his disciple St. Polycarp whom he taught everything, or Polycarp's disciple St. Irenaeus whom he taught everything John had taught him, the latter two who spent their lives hunting down any traces of heterodoxy trying to form in a Church that, itself, was so conservative in its orthodoxy that even the smell of ""innovation"" or ideas that weren't directly sourced from the Apostles was rejected, had introduced the heresies and that literally nobody in that hyper-paranoid time of orthodoxy noticed. Unless you believe that St. John, St. Polycarp, or St. Irenaeus (the man who literally wrote the book ""Against Heresies"" against all the actual heresies) somehow got away with the biggest crime in all of history, then we know that before AD , the unanimous Christian belief, sourced from the apostles, was in favor of things like baptismal regeneration, real presence in the Eucharist, bishops actually having authority, etc. Later RCC doctrines can and should be scrutinized to see where they have their roots, but it's simply a fact that certain Protestant denominations who reject things such as baptismal regeneration are literally at odds with what the apostles passed down just one generation later.",1651423042.0,lit,20290322,1480,244
"It is divisible in the classical sense that arms may be removed from a person, but metaphorically speaking you could not separate the Holy Spirit from God.For example going from having not created to having created, is a change.Potentially, though it is difficult to fathom how ""long"" God may have waited to begin creation. How many units of what counts for existence outside of time passed by before God said ""hey how about some people that'd be cool"" I suppose that is a state of attitudinal change, which may or may not fit your own definitionsthe conflation of God with reality is interesting, because you said God doesn't need to change, yet reality is constantly changing.Reality is operating within established parameters, again definitions here are a bitch because the cycle of ground water to evaporation to rain is a change of form but not of essence. If the rain turned into legal documents then a change of essence occurs, but even that asinine example is lacking in metaphorical weight.some of which are comprehensible and we can describe and even debateIt is difficult, like seeing the face of a clock and ""knowing"" what ""time"" it is, even as there are many moving parts to bring you the ""time"". We know the parts exist, and that they are working to form a complete clock, but then the debate on what constitutes a clock begins. Is a clock a clock if it is missing a piece? Is a clock only a clock if it can tell time? What if the clock tells time but does not tell the ""right"" time? What if a clock tells the time in Australia but not the time in America? What if you cannot read a clock, does it stop telling the correct time? Is a clock a good clock because it tells the time you want (you're not running late at all!) or the time you need? (you're  minutes late!)I would say reality as it exists depends on God being intact, that is, not missing parts or pieces. If God could lose the Holy Spirit, then God would never have needed the Holy Spirit to exist at all, which meant God could not have ever lost the Holy Spirit. It is recursive and acausal, but I ascribe such features to God inherently. I am aware it can seem an awful convenience to have my cake and eat it too, that is:A. God is good becauseB. God is good becauseC. God is....",1651423371.0,lit,20290322,2257,414

"It can be an entertaining series because Martin is a good storyteller and the surrounding fan theories are fun to follow because there is a lot under the surface. That's also why the series will never be finished. Martin wrote himself into an increasingly complex hole and he has no idea how to wrap everything together. It could be worth reading just to understand the clusterfuck for yourself. Aside from that, the series can also be annoying too. Martin is a overweight leftist boomer and the books are exactly what you would expect from somebody like that. There's overly graphic descriptions of food, there's nonsensical political commentary on things like class and money, and then there's the fact that out of the hundreds of instances of sex throughout the series, there's only one or two times that it happens between a married husband and wife. The rest is all rape and incest or some variation of degeneracy because how the atheistic materialistic mind works.I do want to reread the series at some point because I want to count precisely how many times there's a fakeout death, they usually happen at the end of chapter and it's a source of cheap drama to hook the reader. Think of the chapter that ends with Arya getting hit in the head with an axe only to find out a couple chapters later that it was with the blunt side and Arya is completely fine.

"They are both masters in their own way, but have very different styles in what isn't really the same genre. Martin is more dark, low fantasy where people are flawed if not outright horrible. His stories, in his own words, are focused on the human heart in conflict with itself. Tolkien is more abject good vs abject evil, with an almost unfathomable amount of backstory to literally everything. The heros are blindingly bright white champions of honor and justice, selflessly fighting impossible odds and for the most part the ""drama"" is they are one shotting baddies left and right but there are so god damned many of them... and the villains are unquestionably evil who are just raiding and pillaging kind of for no reason.

These are the basis for your boundariesYour job isnt to attract every woman, your job is to learn to screen for women with high potential to be attracted to who you really areWhen you express your truth to a neutral woman you will polarize her. She will either become receptive to you or make herself unreceptive. Either way, this is a good thing. When you express your truth and you communicate more investment into them they will also be not attracted to you and become therefor unreceptiveIf you express your truth and demonstrate that you are non needy and also frictionless for her (same interests and values) then she will become very receptiveBeing polarizing to women is more important than being pleasant to themIf you get rejected or succeed you have won in both cases since you were satisfying your curiosity and found out if she is compatible or notInstead of thinking ""oh i hope she wont reject me"" think ""i hope i will find out if shes right for me""If youre afraid to ask a woman out then you are more invested in her opinion of you than you are invested in yourself.

"Some time back I decided, on a lark, to read Charles Dickens' Pickwick Papers. I was skeptical going in as I had the apprehension that his books were universally tawdry and maudlin, likely due to being forced to read Great Expectations in middle school when I was yet more of a knucklehead even than I am today. What I found, however, was the most hilarious book I had read since Tristram Shandy written in a most charming, enjoyable prose. Nearly every sentence in said book is a joke unto itself, complete with punchline, a tiny journey in pill form It was, to me, magnificent.I next read David Copperfield which I finished just last night. It was also quite good and quite funny. The question I pose to you gentlemen is this: what other Dickens scratches a similar itch as Pickwick Papers. Copperfield nearly did it but Pickwick is too ridiculously funny and good. Recommendations outside of Dickens are also on the table.I thank you for your time.",1651409628.0,lit,20305561,951,167
"Pickwick Papers is my favorite book and, after much searching, I have not found one like it. Here is my theory. When Dickens began writing PP, he was unknown and the publishers forced him to write a comedy, and restrained his natural, expansive sentimentalism. That is why the sad moments in the book, like Mr Weller reflecting on the death of his wife, is so restrain compared to later Dickens novels. Funnily enough, when dickens was restrained when writing sad moments, he wrote them better.Pickwick Papers is the only book I ever read twice in a row.

It is much, much better than much of what is considered essential reading here or anywhere. Further, I was shocked to find it rated so lowly when I looked at fora outside of the one with which we are presently engaged (a practice which always seems to end in regret for me). Many complaints that it was 'uneven' (fair) and 'too long' (preposterous). I could quite frankly quite happily read about the adventures of Sam Weller &c for the rest of my natural life.I fear my OP did not give David Copperfield a completely fair shakeI will make a note of this suggestion. I think I will probably read all of Dickens eventually.I should note that other novels I have greatly enjoyed and which I associate with the style of the Pickwick Papers are Tom Jones, Tristram Shandy. The Mayor of Casterbridge had some negligible overlap for me but I liked it a lot. The Way of all Flesh almost approaches it and has many very clever and funny points but I found it, in the end, to be reddit and homosexual.I was thinking that should I not find what I am looking for in Dickens, I would turn to reading through the english picaresque novels of the th and th century.",1651433732.0,lit,20305561,1429,265

Etc) make me suspect that, but when he wrote about the tall bitch literally squirting in her panties from seeing Duncan throw a rope from the top of the Wall, I knew that Frank was a old man virgin who had never talked to a woman in his entire life.I wrote him a letter telling him as such. I loved most of the book, and told him that as well, but I warned him next time to not make it so obvious that he had no idea what sex was or how women thought and felt. I had written him before, after Messiah was published I think, and had gotten back some typed up “thanks for writing!” Bullshit that I know he just has printed off in the hundred and signs when he needs. But he didn’t reply to this letter.Imagine my surprise when his “son” started writing in his stead after his death.

"So you know how the point of dune is the biological improvement of humans? Well, the problem is that in the setting this is entirely done with selective breeding and other traditional methods, despite the series explicitly establishing that artificial genetic engineering is extremely powerful in the setting. The only reason the author gives for why everybody isn't engineered artifically is that most factions consider artifical genetic modifications icky, which frankly feels incredibly petty by the author.

It ceases to be human.That said, not all human-like creatures can be considered fully human either, which is the point of the gom jabar test.Look at the real world. Do you really want the current crop of elites and billionaires to genetically engineer your kid? Of course not, they're entirely untrustworthy. Every time they do something, a few years later it turns out they were doing absolutely evil stuff and doing a poor job of hiding it. You can't trust them to run a newspaper ethically, let alone a genetic engineering clinic. The first thing they'll do is make sure every embryo they modify has plenty of genes that confer obedience to authority figures, and then after that they'll tighten IQ to the midwit level (-).

"I'm finishing up Thus Spoke Zarathustra and I want to talk about the overman. Is the overman supposed to be a real person or a heroic ideal that society sets for itself?(/)Nietzsche's main point of contention with his regime was that he viewed it as striving to eliminate the virtues of humanity that differentiated it from animals: heroic struggle, aesthetic greatness, and so on. Lacking these, the last man is thus ""the flea-beetle"" and ""even now, too, man is more ape than any ape."" As Fukuyama points out in his essay The Last Man:A dog is content to sleep in the sun all day provided he is fed, because he is not dissatisfied with what he is. He does not worry that other dogs are doing better than him, or that his career as a dog has stagnated, or that dogs are being oppressed in a distant part of the world. If man reaches a society in which he was succeeded in abolishing injustice, his life will come to resemble that of a dog.Nietzsche views this as the telos that man has set for himself under enlightenment liberalism/democracy. So he asserts that ""[t]he Overman is the meaning of the earth"", which I took to be a contrary telos. I don't get the impression he's talking about a real person but, because he plays in the language of religion and hymn, a heroic myth. The Overman is intended to be to us what Odysseus was to the Greeks, what Beowulf was to the Old English, and what Gilgamesh was to the Mesopotamians. It's an aspirational, heroic ideal that a civilization sets for itself, a telos, in this case one intended to oppose the last man, to ""overcome man"" and nihilism, and to serve as a bridge to a future where man's virtues are preserved. So I don't get the impression that he's telling the reader to become the Overman, but rather telling society to construct for itself a new vision of heroism for modernity.In the context of his time, he logically envisions this as inimical to Christianity. As Max Weber pointed out, the Protestant spirit animated the German Confederation's bureaucracy and economic order, both of which Nietzsche disdained. He thus concludes that the Overman must therefore be an assertion of archaic aristocratic ideals against the slave morality that drives this system.Was he right about this? Assuming I'm not wrong about the Overman being a heroic myth intended to overcome nihilism and the last man, couldn't it really be anything?",1651425885.0,lit,20306626,2386,418
"(/)I think back to the immediate postwar period in the United States, during the s and s, which was marked by concerns about ""mass man"". It featured a resurgence of interest in the novels of Franz Kafka, who emerged from a similar cultural context as Nietzsche and whose work featured the excesses of large, impersonal, and irrational bureaucracies. A major reaction to this mood was the objectivism expressed in the work of Ayn Rand, who sought to reimagine mythological heroism within the context of industrial capitalism. Reading Rand, it seems as though objectivism is less of a coherent philosophy and more of a collective effort to construct a heroic ideal within a period she and Nietzsche viewed as needing one. My thinking, then, is that the objectivist project is an example of people trying to create the Overman. Regardless of how stupid we might see Rand as being, could she be said to have been doing Nietzsche? Am I completely wrong here?A second reaction to this period was rock and roll, embodied in the meteoric rise of Elvis Presley. Elvis the cultural symbol eventually dwarfed Elvis the man, and gave rise to the rock star as a fixture in American culture for the next half century. It looks to me, especially considering the mythos and behavior that would develop around rock music in the next half century, like it was offering something beyond the stultifying nihilism people perceived during the 's. It played a role in undermining Soviet ideology, and diffused into movements like punk, where a devoted subculture gathered to build a common aesthetic project. It took on an outsized importance in how people in the West would understand and find meaning in the world. Mark Fisher, for example, asserts that there's been ""a slow cancellation of the future"". Why? Because albums as good as Sly and the Family Stone's ""There's a Riot Gon' On"" don't come out anymore.Maybe this is a much dumber comparison than to Rand, but couldn't we also say that Elvis qua cultural symbol, hero, and myth is an Overman? Despite not being obviously Nietzschean in the same way as Rand's heroes, he seems to check a lot of the boxes. He created a ""bridge"" toward a cultural tradition that endured at least fifty years, one in direct confrontation with the nihilism Nietzsche perceived at the heart of the enlightenment regime.I might be totally wrong here, but I think it's interesting to think about. My impression from Thus Spoke Zarathustra was that the essential qualities of the Overman are his antagonism toward nihilism/the last man and his carrying forward the torch of humanity. Given the cultural context in which Nietzsche was writing, he was inevitably imbued with the traits of archaic aristocracy. But it seems as though these are secondary, no? Elvis lacked the aristocratic traits Nietzsche envisioned the Overman as having, but he seemed to serve a similar function.",1651428331.0,lit,20306626,2890,485
"(/)I ask because it seems as though Nietzsche's fundamental claim, that a new heroic ideal is needed to overcome nihilism, is correct. His critics like Alasdair MacIntyre in After Virtue, though, will describe the Overman as dangerous and delusional, recommending instead a reversion to Aristotelian virtue. But this strikes me as a tendentious reading of Nietzsche, because it seems like we can accept the fundamental claim being made while rejecting the parts of it that emerge from Nietzsche's contempt for the culture he was writing in.Because can't we imagine venues for heroism, the human spirit, and history that aren't necessarily war or ideological conflict? In The Last Man, Fukuyama writes:The Alpinist has, in short, re-created for him or herself all the conditions of historical struggle: danger, disease, hard work, and finally the risk of violent death. But the object has ceased to be an historical one, and is now purely formal: for example, being the first American or German to ascend K- or Nanga Parbat, and when that has been accomplished, being the first to ascend without oxygen, etc.Fukuyama considers sports to be a venue for the human spirit, although one that has ceased to be historical. This is true, but what about the arts?[Kojeve] indicated that the end of history meant also the end of both art and philosophy... It would no longer be possible to create the great art that was meant to capture the highest aspirations of an era, like Homer's Iliad, the Madonnas of da Vinci or Michelangelo, or the giant Buddha of Kamakura, for there would be no new eras and no particular distinction of the human spirit for artists to portray. They could write endless poems on the beauties of springtime or the graceful swell of a young girl's breast, but they could not say anything fundamentally new about the human situation.Nietzsche, himself familiar with Hegel, foresaw this claim:And I saw a great sadness come over mankind. The best turned weary of their works. A doctrine appeared, a faith ran beside it: 'All is empty, all is alike, all has been!' And from all hills there re-echoed: 'All is empty, all is alike, all has been!'Going back to Elvis, weren't Western rock and pop a venue for historical struggle that operated independently of actual historical struggle? We would say that albums like Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band or the Beach Boys' Smile were historic albums, and that punk was a historic movement. I don't think the existence of the Soviet Union and thus grand historic conflict were necessary for them to be such. They were completely arbitrary, but nonetheless took on enormous cultural significance.This is why I wonder if the characteristics of the Overman is also arbitrary aside from his role in confronting nihilism and the last man. Elvis fulfilled the same function and, with the death of Western music culture observed by Mark Fisher, maybe we can just imagine a new one to carry forth the human spirit",1651429747.0,lit,20306626,2965,496

"If you read one or two, you read them all. Most of them have ok advices if you are young, lost or never read a book in your life but it all comes down to: stop being a lazy consoomer and pitying yourself and chasing women, money or approval of others and start being disciplined, learning skills and constructive thought and working to be better and achieve things you want.If you are not retarded all this is common sense presented in a sterile, autistic way. They are beating a dead horse with the fact that there are thousands of self help books. But selling books and courses on how to live your life to millions of clueless young people who grew up without a father figure will make you easy money if you are willing to be a low key cult leader.

"Change your environment preferably to somewhere nobody knows youForge a new personalityFake it till you make it. 'Making it' will happen when you start believing your own bullshit.People will eventually believe your bullshit, sometimes even before you do.Congrats you have new personality. This should take up to a year. Maybe more if you are really screwed, and probably less if you aren't mentally insane. When you go back to your old environment, you will believe your own shit enough to convince them you've changed. Don't go back too soon because they won't say any significant change until enough time has passed. For me it started with making eye contact with everyone I walked past. I couldn't get laid before but now, I'm getting more women than I care for. I still stumble and fall a few times, but I know I'm gonna be fine.
